My goodness, after a support ticket was lodged it was just a black hole. I bumped the thread up 4 times over a week, and there was still no reply despite them saying they'd reply within 72 hours.

My losses aren't much, but this is out of sheer principle on how to not manage an e-wallet and to protect yourself when using electronic wallets where your money can disappear by simply running an SQL UPDATE or DELETE on the database.

Ryde's wallet feature allows transaction records to disappear completely at the whim of customer service when you have an issue with them. Apparently, Ryde thinks that by deleting the transaction record and removing it from the wallet history, they've successfully completed a refund for a ride. This is despite the ride still being on pickup status where I can see the driver's messages, plate number, and even a CANCEL button with the $5.30 cancellation charge to be billed to me if I continue with a cancellation.

There is no +$xx in credit on my wallet's transaction history corresponding to the fare, which seemingly would be the right thing to do when managing an e-wallet.

Imagine if a your bank's credit or debit card were to do this, where the bank would delete the record from your transaction history entirely and claim that a refund was done because the transaction is no longer there. I cannot imagine ANY e-wallet that does this and lets customer service edit or remove entries.

Definitely a 101 on how to not manage e-wallets for decent company.

---

Background: A few weeks ago, a Ryde driver completed a ride without picking me up. My wallet's transaction history clearly showed the record of the transaction with the date and timestamp. Other than a little annoyance, I didn't think too much of it and hence sent off support ticket to Ryde and asked for the money back. Ryde's support took 27 hours to reply to the case and claims that the ride was refunded. 

However, my balance wasn't updated and there was no way to reply to the ticket because Ryde support has a policy of closing tickets immediately so that customers cannot contact them for a follow up. I had to find other means to inform them that my balance did NOT increase. The second ticket told me that it can take a while due to bank processing time and to check with my bank (when my ride was paid with RydeCoins and not a credit card).

3 weeks later, they're ignoring tickets or sending template replies, such as by informing me that the transaction and refund ""may not be visible for your wallet history"" after a refund is processed.",Use Ryde Wallet / RydeCoins? Screenshot your Ryde e-wallet balance every now and then as Ryde's Wallet Feature has potentially has NO INTEGRITY CHECKS.

singapore,"Just some quick context. I took an Interior Design diploma but lost interest and did not pursue it. After NS, decided to join the workforce and worked in the government sector but only for a little over a year. I then went into security for about 3 years. Some time during COVID, I resigned cos of the long and odd working hours and few other reasons. In hindsight, I probably should’ve resigned with a plan but yeah, there I was. So I had no plan and no ambition. I ended up just doing food delivery in the meantime. I wasn’t planning to do it long-term and it’s been a year so I’ve been looking into getting full-time employment. But like I said, no ambition. I don’t really have anything I’m interested in to want to do as a job. Not to mention, I don’t have any marketable skills or experience from my previous jobs. I want to avoid going back as much as possible. Going back to school was certainly in consideration but I can’t really sustain myself financially if I study full-time. So after, talking to some people I personally know, some online, read some stuff up and even consulted career coaches, I found out and am highly considering going into a Career Conversion Program.

So I just want to know if there any other redditors who have gone through these programs. What was it like ? Did it really help in attaining the skills needed for that field ? Just want to know the experience is like 

Also, for career switchers in general : what route did you take to switch fields ? What was the reason ? What were the challenges you faced going into an unknown field ? And if you’re like me, who want to switch professions but not really sure what you want to do, how did you decide ?

And taking a bit of an advice from someone, since I didn’t know what I wanted to do, they suggested thinking of something that I will hate the least. And from the available programs, I narrowed it to maybe Electrical Engineering or IT Analyst. Anybody in the field can help explain a bit more what the profession is about ?

Thanks in advance for your responses",What can you expect from a Career Conversion Program (CCP) ? Also just career switching in general

I'm currently serving around my 5th/6th cycle of reservist, and after not having been called back for 2 years due to deferment, I realised a stark change in how things run in my unit.

Manpower seems tighter than ever - the new NSF intake into the unit is a 1/4 of what it was during my time, and all the young regulars seem to be resigning due to mismanagement and inability to cope with the manpower shortage - nearly all the young regulars I patrolled with during my time as an NSF aren't there anymore. 

And this is still the generation with an 'okay' birthrate, in 10 years time, will there still be manpower, both in NSF and regulars in order to keep things running?",Is NS sustainable in the near-future?

singapore,"Don’t get me wrong, I am for a better system of integration for the future residents of Singapore. 

However, I am not for the implementation of an English proficiency test as a better way of integrating them into the society.

Personally, my mum is a naturalised sg citizen. Till today, she still has some problems with her english and finds it challenging with communicating with others in english. However, there is a significant improvement in her standard of english communication over the years just by living in Singapore.

However, no matter how hard she tried, she still cannot achieve the level of proficiency most of us have. It is not from a lack of trying though. Learning a language when you’re older is just not the same as when you’re young. Moreover, having to juggle between work and family makes it even harder for her to learn English properly.

Even when she tries to communicate in English to others, the accent she has receives stares from others occasionally which makes her even more uncomfortable with using the language.

Not being able to speak English doesn’t make her a lesser citizen. She works and pays her taxes like any other singaporean. Contributes to cpf like any other singaporean. Eats at the hawker like any other singaporean 

The process of migration and integration is not easy. Adding another test on top of that just makes things even more stressful for people like them.",Hear me out - why I disagree with the English proficiency test for the future residents of Singapore (personal example)

singapore,[removed],Pitter patter
singapore,"First time posting here so I am a little anxious but I really need some possibly legal advice right now. 

For context, I am a current uni student and have been diagnosed with a medical condition which requires me to undergo surgery recently. For my surgery, I previously asked for pre-authorisation from my medical insurance but initially due to not having sufficient documentation from my attending doctor and some confusion from the insurer’s part, the pre-authorisation didn’t go through and so I went for my surgery without the backing of my insurance.

After my insurance I sought for another letter from my attending doctor and this time they approved the claim and paid me back the money for the surgery. But a week later, the company suddenly emailed me and ask for a refund citing that they have paid me “mistakenly” and the reason was my treatment was under an exclusion clause. For context, I have previous medical history of an endocrine condition that is completely separate and unrelated to my surgery, and unfortunately treatment for the endocrine condition is excluded under the policy. I think it was because this endocrine condition was detailed in my doctors letter which have made them  mistakenly think that I was seeking to claim for my endocrine condition. After clarifying with them that I was claiming for surgery and NOT my endocrine condition they still insisted that I refund them the money while they continue to ‘investigate’ and I just got really worried whether insurance companies are allowed to demand money back from  people anytime after the claim was approved and whether they have the right to do so (meaning if I ever get another surgery would they suddenly ask for a repayment a few years later???). And also possibly wondering why they approved the claim if it was not finalised and then demand for the sum back. 

The issue i have now is I don’t come from a well to do financial background so while to the insurers and most redditors here I believe it rly is not that big of a sum of money, I immediately used a large portion of the sum to offset my surgery fees when they transferred the sum to me . Little did I know that situations like an insurance calling for a refund is even possible. After speaking to others they told me that debt collectors (??) may come after me if I don’t pay up as soon as possible or even get myself into a possible lawsuit?? So I am now really anxious if that will really happen and in the mean time I’m trying to get the sum back as of now. Sorry for the lack of knowledge here as I am rather new to insurance policies. Is there any official outlet or ministry I can contact for help about this? Thanks for the help in advance!!",Insurance company asked for refund. What do I do?

I panicked, my sister panicked, A LOT. We tried retracing our steps, asking the shopkeepers nearby and calling my phone but nothing seemed to help me get closer to finding my phone. 

I thought I genuinely needed to file a police report until we got a call from my number and when we answered, no one was speaking on the other end - all we could hear was the sound of the crowd and the rain. After a minute or so of saying hello they finally responded and told me where they found it and where they were and luckily it was nearby where my sister and I were. 

We met up with them and they were the most pleasant people! They said they were about to actually head home until they found my phone on the floor so they decided to stay around the area and grab a meal in hopes that I’ll come to find them and thank God I did. We thanked them numerous times and left… but before going home we decided to buy them chocolate waffles from a nearby bakery and luckily the waffles were done before they left the food court. 

First time in a long time I personally lost something in public and I couldn’t be any more grateful that I came across such wonderful people at the end of it all :)","To the elderly couple who held onto my phone when I lost it, thank you."

singapore,"Over the last 5-6 years, ive kept in touch with the mental inadequacies of Singapore. As a country, there were steps in our past that definitely contributed to the current crisis we have now.  


So here are some possible thinking points i had that could help to improve our mental health  
1) The most blatanly obvious one is the addition of more places where people can seek help regarding mental health. Just over a decade ago we had the removal of our 2nd Mental instituition, View Road Mental Hospital. Leaving the sole mental Hospital to be IMH, with a compacity of just over 3000. It is very clear that this hospital alone cant sustain the mental health compacity of a coutry with a population of nearly 8 million.  


Give incentives for people who work in the physchology field, give them another reason to become a cousellor or help to counsell someone. Then open more new establishment to gives these people a government job that is stable.  


2)The next important is a step i am surprised i have yet to see in schools. Teaching kids about Mental Illness is one thing but the depth of knowledge taught is deinitely not enough. What the schools should also teach is how treatments could help on top of the usual ""Where to find help"". A good example are the drugs that a therapist may prescibe, it would be way better to teach students on how these drugs is able to chemically improve their mental well being.   


Like how anti-depressants take weeks to actually become effective. A Commodity among people who have depression is having a low chemical Massenger called Serotonin. Serotonin stabilizes your mood especially Happiness. Anti-Depressants increases the production of Serotonin, thus improving your mood and level of happiness.  


A Misconception with anti-depressants is how it will basically remove depression. It will not, however. What it does do is bring a person's state of mind to a point where they have the energy to do something that could give them purpose. Hence, one should only take anti-depressants when the time is allocated and not take more than is required. Taking more can result in ireversible damage to your organs.  


3) Governmnet working with companies to ensure someone who have seek a therapist can secure a simillar job after visiting one. This will somewhat help people who think their job may be in jeopardy and hence are reluctant to seek help, let them know. Seeking help wont cause them too go days without a job if they get fired or quit because of pressue. Give these people the choice of similalr alternatives that readily accept these folks back into the workforce.

Other than these three, what other steps do you think the government can take to improve Mental health in singapore?","Mental Health, Talk of the decade."
singapore,"Firstly and most importantly, no one died at the scene. This is just a recounting of events that I want to get off my chest. I should be asleep but I can’t seem to.

I alighted at Jln Kayu today about 6pm to walk home and barely 30s later, there were brakes screeching. When I turned back for a look, two people were on the ground, one on the road and another on the grass patch by the sidewalk. A car had hit two pedestrians crossing the road, windshield had a large spiderweb crack, the person on the road (a malay lady) kinda sat up and slowly moved herself to the kerb. The one on the grass wasn’t moving and ngl I feared for the worst until i saw the person stir a bit.

I called 995 after freezing for a bit, tried to give the location of the accident and they sent traffic police and an ambulance. Another uncle closer to the victims was on the phone with either 995 or traffic police too. The lady was still on the kerb, but she had to move as the driver of the car was moving it to a small parking area on the side of the road (traffic only has 1 lane per direction at J. kayu, and other drivers had to drive past in the other lane). 

Another malay auntie and I helped her to the kerb, where she sat/leaned against a fire hydrant. The other person involved was a kid, a young malay boy. I believe he was the one who took the brunt of the impact, considering he was flung onto the grass. The pedestrians nearby came over and soothed him, made sure he didn’t move his head in case of a neck injury. Since there were more than enough people attending to the boy, I went to the lady instead and checked on her. Her lips were very pale and almost white, and she was giddy (probably in shock). I talked to her for a bit and convinced her to sit down on the ground as I was genuinely afraid she would pass out. The same malay auntie who helped earlier came back with a pack of lemon tea for her, which appeared to help.

After the ambulance/traffic police came, the EMTs took the boy to KKH with a neck brace first while the EMTs from a second ambulance (arrived about 5-10 min later) tended to the lady. I relayed whatever info i could to the EMT, gave my statement to the traffic policeman (apparently since I called 995, they have my info/statement and so I didn’t exactly need to give one to him) and went off first.

Apparently the lady is a teacher at the Islamic school on the shophouse side of J. Kayu, and she had been escorting him across the road. She had crossed behind a bus on her side of the road, and from where she was looking, there was no incoming traffic on the other side. However, it was a blind spot and I believe the driver was unable to brake in time. Another teacher came to provide assistance, and I think she accompanied the kid to the hospital. I sincerely hope that they both recover with no lasting effects..",Witnessed a traffic accident today and can’t sleep

singapore,,The fertility rate will skyrocket after this year
singapore,"So for some context, my dad was talking to me about how he got scammed by the condo manager (if ppl are interested, I'll add details in the comments) and has got me a bit paranoid about making payments.

I recently left a job, and after all the due processes and stuff, was told by the HR that I'd need to pay the company back (for some benefits they had paid me for). I suspected I might have to pay this, but it was a bit ambiguous. But now that the HR told me so, I just complied and followed the instructions. He sent me the bank details to transfer to, etc. But now I think about it, I have no idea who I just paid. 

So there are 2 possible scenarios. 

1. Completely legit. No explanation needed.
2. HR guy saw that I was overpaid. Even though the company doesn't require me to pay them back, he realizes I don't know this. He is my only point of contact with the HR and he knows this.

So he creates an account, tells me I actually owe the company some money, and need to transfer into this account. I comply because I think it sounds about right. The company doesn't know any better because they weren't expecting any repayment, so when they audit their books, there's no missing cash.

Possible ""red flags"" : bank account is different/unknown to me. There's no official receipt from the company. He asked me to send a ss of the bank transfer to confirm I had repaid the amount.

Possible ""green flags"" : could be perfectly normal. HR guy has been my point of contact for over 3 years. I half expected I'd need to repay.

I realised there's no way to find out what account I transferred to. The transfer details do not include the name of the recipient (for security reasons, bank also can't tell me. Which makes sense. If some rando transfers $1 to me, I'd expect the bank not to reveal my account name to the rando). 

So how do I verify that this is legitimate, that the payment went to the company and not the HR guys own account?",How do you verify who you are paying

singapore,"A week ago, I did a simple exercise of pulling out some data from [SingStat](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/) regarding our demographics trends and shared it with this sub. It was a bit all over the place and didn't really have much of a point, so I'm re-organizing it and sharing it with some new data. Thanks to u/DrCalFun and u/mikemarvel21 for their critic, among other u/.

I also attempted to do demographic/citizen projections but apparently UN has already did all the hard work for us [here](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/702).

|SG Pop Median Projections|2020|2030|2040|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Age 0-19 (mil)|1.0|1.0|0.9|
|Age 20-64 (mil)|4.0|3.8|3.6|
|Age 65 and Over (mil)|0.7|1.4|1.9|
|Total Population|5.7|6.2|6.4|
|Working Class (20-64) %|70%|62%|56%|
|Working class to Dependents|2.35|1.62|1.27|

SG is projected to peak out at \~6.4m people around 2040 inclusive of new citizens and FTs, then the 1.1 fertility rate takes over and our population will drop by 0.5% annually, assuming immigration policies remain constant. 

***This means most of us &lt;40yr old, in 20yrs time, will have double the burden of supporting elderly and kids (if any) through taxes, expenditure!*** Will we have to raise taxes further to fund socialist spending or do we go full capitalist and let our elderly figure it out on their own? That will be an interesting debate in years to come.

In 50 years time, can you imagine figuratively, a single 25 y/o grandchild paying taxes to subsidize social welfare of 2 60y/o parents and (up to) 4 90 y/o grandparents? 

There was also interest in housing in my previous post. Taking u/DrCalFun's suggestion, I had a closer look at household data.

||2021|2020|2010|2000|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Population (m)|5.4536|5.6858|5.0767|4.0279|
|Citizens (m)|3.4982|5.5232|3.2307|2.9859|
|\-----|||||
|Avg Hsehold Size|3.09|3.22|3.50|3.70|
|Citizen Hseholds (mil)|1.1321|1.0942|0.9231|0.8070|
|Citizen Hsehold Chg (2000)|40.3%|35.6%|14.4%|\-|
|Total HDB (mil units)|1.093|1.079|0.899|0.843|
|HDB Increase (2000)|29.6%|28.0%|6.5%|\-|
|HDB units vs hseholds|\-39,206|\-14,531|\-24,525|36,299|
|Total Dwellings (mil units)|1.484|1.456|1.157|1.036|
|Dwelling Increase (2000)|43.2%|40.5%|11.6%|\-|

I think this table makes it pretty clear why there is so much angst in housing. As household sizes shrunk since 2000, we've had \~40.3% increase in number of citizen households and only a 29.6% increase in HDB flats. We have a shortage of 39k HDB units if all citizen households lived in public housing compared to 36k surplus in 2000. 

HDB [projects](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/28102022-3Q2022-RPI) completion of 23k units for 2022 and 2023 each, and a total of 100k new units between 2021 and 2025. Assuming we have 22k new citizens a year (\~7k households), this shortfall will still take at least till 2024 to clear up. Having said that, we have been in deficit since 2010, way before the debate of rocketing home prices came about. Is HDB trying to hold out and let their TOPs hit the markets in 2yrs?

My thoughts:

My opinion is that it isn't completely a case of home prices rapidly appreciating, but also because the value of fiat currency (globally) has collapsed, due to massive money printing from the developed world's central banks. What this means is that ***our youth &lt;35, with mainly cash savings, are seeing their net worth erode***, while our mature families are still relatively unscathed due to home ownership/asset inflation. Now add this to our increased social support burden in 20 yrs time and it just looks really bleak. Youth in Japan/Europe are already facing these problems, as is USA, and China and Korea will likely follow suit within a decade or so. 

Objectively, I think certain policies such as the recent budget as well as existing immigration policies are essential to reduce the burden on the working adults (today's youth) in the future. However, housing policy seems to have been myopic, to be very polite. Given the slow moving nature of the housing market, it will take a really long time for demand/supply gap to be fixed. 

***TL;DR: People under 40years old are going to have a tough time in 20 years time unless we deal with the population pyramid trajectory. Everything is also probably going to get more expensive from here out.***  

PS: This post is just a slice and dice of historical and projection data for curiosity's sake. While I am happy to discuss specific policies, I'd refrain from commenting on politics in general.

singapore," **TL;DR at the bottom!**

If someone suggested this before and there was a constructive debate over this, please link me. I can't find anything in recent history.

Here's my idea that I hope any sensible MP can bring up regarding our ridiculous COE prices.

The whole reason for 'COE' was originally to control the number of cars on the road so traffic is sustainable. Fair enough. Now it's widening the inequality gap between rich and poor. I know rich people whose households own multiple cars. The father, wife, son, daughter, everyone in the immediate family has their own car. 1 person might even have multiple cars in their garage. Bidding for the COE is literally not an issue for them. Even if COE is 200k tomorrow they will snap their fingers and buy a new car because at that point of wealth, the price doesn't matter anymore. Do you think they feel alot of pain when their Porsche costs $900k instead of $800k?

Meanwhile, middle and lower income families could really use a family car to settle their transportation needs. The utility value for them is so much more important than the wealthy dude who needs a *10th Ferrari to flex*.

**How to solve this?**

Why not let every *Singapore Citizen* household (with minimally a married couple, with or without kids), to have their first COE heavily subsidized or price capped to something more affordable e.g. $25k? Then, every subsequent car that you want to buy within the household (like if you're getting a 2nd car within the family), the price of that 2nd COE will skyrocket to $200k (I'm using random numbers here btw, you get the gist that the 2nd COE price should be deservedly higher because it's a greed, not a need for the family). If you still want to greed a 3rd car, 4th car, the COE becomes exponentially higher like $300k, $500k. Because a mega-wealthy person that can buy multiple cars without flinching can contribute to the subsidy this way. And a lot of people like that exist in Singapore, just take a walk around Bukit Timah estates. Not even exaggerating here.

This solves the **first counter-argument** to this proposal - if people want to say the government has to commercialize COE like a business, then LTA still gets their profit - but at least they extract more money from the upper-rich class who insists on having more than 1 car. Households (especially those with kids to fetch) who really need that ONE car will be happy to pay a subsidized fee, and rich families (who really WANT that 2nd car for pure flexing, idk) will also be happy to pay a more expensive $200k COE. I mean, if you're a 'rich' family and you're not happy at paying an additional $100k levy for multiple cars then maybe consider that you don't really need a second car in the first place? The irony right?

**Second counter-argument:** you may say that COE prices are sky-high now because of all the private-hire companies buying up COE bids and placing more rental cars on the road - in this case, there should be a separate category for private-hire car COEs. Let all the corporate companies have a bidding war against each other. Let it be a free market competition amongst the corporate giants. Leave us peasants out of it. I really don't care if Grab or Gojek or Tada goes bankrupt and loses the war. With this implementation, the demand for private-hire car rides will naturally drop because most lower and middle income families are able to have their own family car, and we won't see the need for so much parents ferrying kids around in grab. A side-effect is that more people will take public transport too, if the prices of taking Grab becomes too disgustingly high because of this new implementation.

**Third counter-argument:** Single people! (I'm single too btw). There can be a single-bid category as well, but I expect this to be as expensive as our current COE prices, being left up to free market forces (*but without the pesky private-hire companies chupping in ofc*). Obviously, the rich single people will bid it upwards while the poorer ones have to suck it up and consider whether it's worth it to pay 100k for a paper (no difference from today) If you have a better idea for singles please suggest in the comments below!

**Final counter-argument:** If the household has way too many kids (&gt;4 kids), they may consider appealing to the government for a subsidized COE for a 2nd car due to the nature of having a large family, and this appeal is more likely to go through especially when the kids have gone past &gt;25 years old and are of working age. Anyway, I think this problem may solve itself because if all the kids are finally in the working stages of their life, they can consider getting married and create a new household, thus being eligible for their 1st car subsidy.

Redditors and economists, please feel free to criticize, poke holes in this theory, and explain why this isn't a point that can be brought up in parliament or even considered by them LTA scholars.

**TL;DR** COE system should change - 1st car for every family household be heavily subsidized, then any additional car without legit reasons should be slapped with a way more expensive COE to make up for the subsidized ones. The supply of cars on the road will be the same.",Can the government tweak COE policy to make it more fair? Details inside!

singapore,,Singapore’s soaring expat rents undermine bid to oust Hong Kong as finance hub
singapore,"
	Two years ago, Lauren arrived in Singapore from Hong Kong wanting more living space for her growing family. Now, they intend to move back. The reason: a 61 per cent increase in the rent on their four-bedroom flat and the high and rising cost of living.

A British mother of three whose husband works in finance, Lauren, who did not want to use her full name, said her experience of Asia’s two rival financial centres has been an eye opener. “Everyone thinks Hong Kong is the most expensive city,” she said.

Her situation is not unusual in the cosmopolitan city-state of 5.6mn people in which a quarter of the workforce is foreign.


A lack of housing supply due to construction delays during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as a wave of new arrivals from places including Hong Kong, China, Europe and Japan last year, pushed residential rents to the highest on record, according to the government’s private residential property rental index.

Rent per square foot in some central areas has overtaken Hong Kong for the first time, data shows. Analysts warn that prices could rise as much as 20 per cent again this year as real estate agents report bidding frenzies for desirable properties.

The situation underscores the cost of Singapore’s campaign to replace Hong Kong as the Asian destination for money and investment. Tough Covid-19 restrictions in the Chinese territory encouraged many to relocate, and the number of Employment Pass and S Pass holders — the main visas used by foreign professionals — increased 4.5 per cent to 338,000 in the 18 months until the end of June last year.

But higher rental prices could undermine Singapore’s attempts to become Asia’s dominant financial hub and attract the best talent, experts said.



Singapore’s government has been reluctant to help a mostly affluent minority. In November, in response to questions from members of parliament, it said that rent was only one factor for those considering a move to the city-state.

Others “include Singapore’s standing as a global business hub, our strong external connectivity, our good trade links, our education and healthcare standards and the quality of life”, said Desmond Lee, minister for national development.

Still, the high cost of living in Singapore, even with low taxes, is creating a “real crunch”, said Woo Jun Jie, a senior research fellow at Singapore’s Institute of Policy Studies. “It is something foreigners face more of the brunt of because most locals live in public housing and go to public schools.” About 80 per cent of Singaporeans live in lower-cost public housing.

“Singapore had a huge influx of people and business since Covid, we were seen as a safe haven during the pandemic. But [high rents] will affect Singapore as a business hub and I think some of it [business] will inevitably flow back into other markets, especially smaller players,” he added.


Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at the ERA Realty Network, said rents could increase another 10 to 20 per cent this year. “Singapore’s small size means when you apply temperature, things boil fast. There is not a lot of spare capacity,” he said.

Emma, a marketing professional, moved with her family to Singapore from Hong Kong five years ago and was living in a three-bedroom flat in the island-resort area of Sentosa. The landlord informed her in November the rent would increase from S$7,000 ($5,200) per month to S$14,000. When they tried to negotiate, they were told to look in other suburbs.

“Our salaries have not gone up by 100 per cent or even 50 per cent — that is all our savings,” she added. She did not want her real name to be used for fear of jeopardising negotiations over their deposit. The family has since decided to return to Australia.


Shantanu Upadhuay, from India, works at a popular restaurant as front-of-house staff in the city’s Chinatown district. The 29-year-old is also moving to Australia with his fiancée after his S$500 rent more than doubled. “I can’t see myself getting ahead here, I have no savings now. In Australia, you can afford a car and have a life,” he said.

Real estate agents agree there is a problem. “I witnessed a crazy incident last year with tenants outbidding each other. It lost control. People are very upset,” said Edna Liong, who liaises with tenants for Huttons Asia. “What some landlords are asking for is not reasonable.”

Another agent, Ina Sultan of ERA, this month made headlines for asking 11 Chinese tenants to vacate their overcrowded flat in a public housing unit. Sultan said: “The problem of overcrowding is not new here, but I expect to see more of this because of prices.”

The bigger picture, agents said, was that rents in Singapore were still catching up after years of decline. “Landlords suffered with low rents for many years and nobody brought this issue up,” Sultan added.



It is clear that for all its attractions, high costs in Singapore are becoming a deterrent, said Jon Goldstein, managing partner of Page Executive Singapore, an executive recruiter. “The question at the mid-level of ‘should we stay or should we go’ — you are hearing that discussion a bit more.”

Even those who have found apartments are unsure about the future.

“If you told me five years ago I would be paying S$6,500 for a very old three-bedroom apartment, I would have said that is insane,” said Marta, a 34-year-old working mother who also did not want her full name to be published for fear of jeopardising her visa.

She moved to the flat last year after her previous landlord asked for a 60 per cent increase in rent. “This was the best option we could find, but after this lease expires we may consider leaving.”",Singapore’s soaring expat rents undermine bid to oust Hong Kong as finance hub

singapore,"I’m not your usual nurse/doctor. I don’t wear scrubs. But I am the last person you see before you leave the hospital. And I know, it’s difficult and ridiculous even to wait for medications for one, two, even three hours. But I also don’t want to take that long to give you your medications.

There are so many steps taken to ensure your safety. We check your prescription against your history, the doctor’s notes and everything else you might be taking from private GPs. 

Imagine this: if you have renal failure, you will eventually be put on at least eight types of medications. Everything from blood pressure, activation of vitamin d to help you utilise calcium for stronger bones, removing toxic waste, and even creating hormones that helps you to produce red blood cells to bring oxygen to your body is regulated by your kidneys. Now imagine packing, checking 6 months supply of your medications. Even if you take 1 tablet once a day, for 6 months that means it’s a good 180 tablets. And some medications can be taken at crazy amounts like 2 tablets 3 times a day. For 6 months? That’s a good 1080 tablets. That’s only one medication.

I’ve been yelled at by patients for their wait time, been told by higher ups saying that they are ‘working on it’. But more and more people are leaving, the pay is not even worth it. I work from 9-6 on weekdays, and at least 1 saturday and 1 sunday shift for a less than 2k salary.

I don’t even know what to suggest to make it better. So I’m asking for help.","To: MOH, MOM, patients. This is my cry for help"

singapore,"Ported over to starhub from singtel about 2 weeks ago as my contract was expiring, got the 5G starhub $28 plan (which doesnt include caller id btw). ABSOLUTE DOGSH*T. For the past 2 weeks i have never had a single day where my connection has been stable for the whole day. 5G coverage my ass, the 5g connection disappears at least once every hr, and sometimes doesnt come back until i restart my mobile network.

Yes I have been sitting at the exact same spot, and I'm not underground. My phone isnt the issue because I've never had an issue with singtel the past year. 

To make things worse, sometimes my data connection goes off COMPLETELY. Meaning the 5G disappears, no 4G, no H+ nothing. Just 0 connection. Even when the 4G appears, nothing loads on my screen, takes half a minute for anything to load. 

Called up starhub, went to the shop to exchange sim card etc, nothing has helped at all. Now I'm stuck with them on a 1 year contract with garbage network services.

So to anyone here looking to recontact/switch telcos, DO NOT CHOOSE STARHUB. Hell even M1 is better at this point. As much as their connection isnt good underground, at least their coverage is consistently stable above ground.",PSA: do NOT change to starhub

singapore,"So I was going home from work late yesterday and had to call a grab as I missed the last train. 

I got into the car and after the driver confirmed my name, the very next thing he asked was ""Guess how much I earned today after working 14 hours on a Sun?""

I was tired and a little sad because Grab was charging me 50% more than usual, but I tried to play nice. At this point, I didn't know if he wanted to complain he made too little, or brag that he made a lot. But I assumed that people were generally humble and just wanted to find common ground that Money No Enough.

So I told him I had no idea what Grab drivers made, but he insisted I hazard a guess. Ok sure, I blindly said $300. He looked offended and told me $800+, after all incentives, his own car, minus petrol etc. Sorry la, I dunno. But I humoured him and said Wow good good. Then he said like that every month can earn 5 figures.

So I said it must be tiring to drive like that. But he told me he only drives when he's free, because he's got a business outside as well.

Then he told me about where he stays, his pri school which was near my home. Then he told me he Pri 5 already got girlfriend. Wah, want to flex his Buaya muscles also.

Then he proceeded to tell me he graduated from NTU and got a MBA from New York.

So basically, smart, works hard, entrepreneurial, got money, and good with ladies. Anyone here wants an intro?

So exhausting la. More exhausting than my work. Does he want validation from me?

Btw I'm a guy.",Grab driver flexed his financial muscles at me.

singapore,"I'm gonna try to make this as uncontroversial as possible (if it is even possible). Obviously it's a sensitive topic, and people have differing views.

But I think by and large, a lot of the racist stuff we see in sg are more societal rather than institutional, like the dude saying interracial marriages are wrong, landlords not wanting Indian tenants, etc. 

When we look at an institutional level (aka the govt policy), there's very few (or some would say no) overtly discriminatory policies. Any policy that is debatably ""racist"" often has some mildly legitimate reason for existing. Whether you agree with the given reason is another matter, and not the point of this post. 

But there's one policy I can't wrap my head around that I think is totally inexcusable but somehow not talked about enough. And that is, how the government classifies malays/muslims as being ""less loyal"" and hence deemed to have lower security clearance when working in govt and even during NS. 

The only argument I've heard is ""what if sg goes to war with Malaysia"". Which makes 0 sense. Because Chinese who were born/have parents from Malaysia are somehow alright. But a malay who has lived here for generations is more likely to betray sg. We even have ministers like khaw boon wan who was born in penang and no one bats an eye.

The government doesn't even have a response. I've tried searching it up, and their response just boils down to denying it happens and alluding to not being able to disclose this for national security reasons. Every other policy that involves race, from ethnic quota for hdb, sap schools, grc, or whatever else, there is at least an attempt to justify their position. Not for this.

And it has a very real impact. Civil servants and military personnel are literally prevented from promoting because of this. I recall there was a post sometime back of someone being let go from the civil service, with hints of it being due to her security clearance/race. 

It fits the most literal definitions of institutional racism. It is the state discriminating on the basis of race.

u_coolcare-singapore," [Aircon service](https://coolcare.com.sg/) is most prominent in Singapore. So here we briefly describe about why [aircon servicing ](https://coolcare.com.sg/), so that you could save your repair cost and aircon for long years. 

* Firstly, Singapore's hot and humid climate means that air conditioners are used extensively throughout the year to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures. This results in a higher frequency of usage and a greater strain on the system, which can lead to wear and tear, breakdowns, and a decrease in efficiency over time.
* Secondly, Singapore's urban environment, with its high levels of pollution, dust, and other contaminants, can cause dirt and debris to accumulate in the aircon's filters and other parts. This can restrict airflow, reduce the aircon's cooling capacity, and create an environment for the growth of mold and bacteria, which can be harmful to health.
* Thirdly, Singapore's high humidity levels create conditions that are conducive to the growth of mold and bacteria in the aircon's ducts, coils, and other parts. This can lead to unpleasant odors, respiratory problems, and other health issues.

# Why should we do frequently aircon servicing in Singapore?

&amp;#x200B;

* Regular[ aircon servicing](https://coolcare.com.sg/) is therefore important to ensure that the system is functioning properly, to maintain good indoor air quality, and to prolong the lifespan of the unit.

singapore,,The Movement to Close Singapore’s Death Row
singapore,"Since the recent debates on local current affairs, I'd thought to share some interesting statistics on our local demographics and data that I dug up. I will be using 2000 as the base for my data.

&amp;#x200B;

||Total Population (mil)|Citizens (mil)|Fertility Rate|% Owner Occupied Resident Households|Total Private Properties ('000)|Total Residential HDB Properties ('000)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022|5.6370|3.5537|1.12\*^(2021)|88.9%|391|1,093|
|2020|5.6858|3.5232|1.10|87.9%|376|1,080|
|2010|5.0767|3.2307|1.15|87.2%|258|989|
|2000|4.0279|2.9859|1.60|92%|193|843|

Source: [SingStat](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/)

To put into perspective, our citizen population has grown by 17.2% in the last 20years, despite having TFR of 1.6 in 2000 and 1.12 last year. If you assume 2000 population as a ""native"" strain, further assume that we lose 0.2% a year up to 2010 then 0.5% annually up to 2022, we've got 0.7-0.75m of new citizens since 2000. 

Total available HDB units increased by 29.5%, and private properties by 102.7%. Total population increase since 2000 is 35.4%, total dwellings increased by 43%. Average household size has shrunk from 3.7 to 3.09 in the same period. 30% increase in HDBs vs 17% increase in HDBs.

I think we have a terrible chicken and egg question to deal with: We aren't replacing ourselves so we need new blood, new blood tends to be inflationary, inflationary conditions makes it hard to replace ourselves. 

I feel the recent budget announcements are throwing fuel into the inflationary fire, and new societal norms are also making it less desirable for couples to have more children, if even any at all. 

At the same time, Singapore has become an extremely desirable place for many of the global elites to relocate to. While the general citizen population is shielded from their competition to relocate here, and our children and elderly benefit from the taxes they pay, we aren't shielded from the inflationary pressures they bring. While many adults will benefit from the job creation, there will be others that get left behind. 

There is no reliable data on how large our silent majority really is, but if you assume we have 0.70-0.75m new citizens (20% of citizens), then further assume \~50% of the remainder are generally satisfied with life, that's still a 60-65% silent majority, or about same % of votes a certain party gets. Coincidence? With the above trend though, this silent majority is likely to grow. 

TL;DR / My own conclusion: Meritocracy is basically Darwinism: Only the fittest survive, and we are all out there in the jungle. Sinkie pls don't pwn sinkie, help hold each other's hands, especially our youth so they don't get left behind.

singapore,"In case you have been living under a rock, rental for residential areas has gone up by a metric fuckton within the last 6 months. 

https://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/news/singapore-rental-index-private-homes-rise-highest-in-24-years

For those of us who don't have our own place or live with our parents, this shit cascades downhill and splashes onto the foreign workforce and international students alike. As someone who was a landlord's rep and drafted more tenancy agreements than I can care to remember, most landlords prefer to stick to 1-year lease periods and the rental increases are looming very shortly.

The people in my team at work are facing a ton of anxiety now. Most employers are not willing to offer raises to compensate for rental increases. It's very rare for employers to include rental support as part of their hiring packages. As a result I can ballpark 90% of my foreigner coworkers are preparing to resign and go home when their leases are done.

3/4 of my interns are international students and this is hitting them particularly hard. Dorm rooms are not guaranteed even for international students and those students are staring down the barrel of increased rental eating up the budget they set aside for food. 2 of the interns are talking about transferring their credits to universities at home.

This shit is serious. If the rental issue doesn't change anytime soon, my team will only have like 2 devs remaining. I suspect teams across the country are at risk of getting hollowed out unless it's some sensitive industry like defense or intelligence. We also run the risk of chasing international students away.

singapore,"I'm just gonna throw it out here, probably getting downvoted to hell, but raising food prices is a necessity for many hawkers. They don't suka-suka raise it.

I'm kinda fed up with seeing so many complaints against the rise of food prices at Hawker Centres/Food Court. My aunt, who is a stall assistant at a Cai Png stall got  insulted by a 'customer' today for the mere fact that the stall had to raise the price everything by 50 cents.

Please understand, the profit margin for running a food stall is already incredibly low as it is. My aunt once was able to earn $2.5k, now even trying to earn $1.5k is difficult. When the price of rental has shot through the roof in recent years, and when the price of every single expense also has increased (ingredients, utilities, general cost of living), these food stalls have no choice but to increase their prices to compensate.

What irks me is the lack of understanding by most. A majority of people moan about the rising food prices without understanding the necessity for it. Or moan about the shrinking portions at the same price aka Shrinflation. I don't see much grumbling directed towards $5-$7 Bubble Tea or McDonald Meals that are reaching the $10 range now.

Believe me, almost no hawker enjoys raise their prices for the fun of it. No hawker enjoys having to cut corners with their food portions.

But with such meagre earnings, such meagre profits, such laborious working hours, I hope more people can emphatise with the plight of most hawkers today instead of complaining.",Raising Food Prices is a necessity for many Hawkers

singapore,"For context, I work at one of the popular kiosks selling fried snacks, particularly curry puffs and recently cheese fries.

We had to display all our wares in the glass showcase, and when customers want to buy their fried snacks, they can just point to what they want and we pack it for them. I can safely say all items move pretty quick. All except our chicken drumstick.

Launch with much fanfair in 2018, the chicken drumstick sells at quite a high price point. One or the JUMBO sized drumsticks costs more than 2 of our signature items. It was launched to compete with the famous fried chicken chain, which had also introduced grilled chicken in their menu, but interest fizzled soon after. We kept ours on the menu, available in selected stores, to make it look exclusive and must-buy item. I didnt know how long the four miserable drumsticks have been with us, but the touted ""juicyness"" has left them long ago. And reheated so many times, they look ""jumbo"" maybe to a mouse.

In any case, i have an unsuspecting customer who must not have had chicken for a long time. His turn came after a long queue and ordered: one curry puff amd one drumstick! My heart missed a beat. Did he just ordered ""that""? ""The drumstick?"" I asked fearfully, afraid that he would change his mind. He affirmed his reply. I quickly packed his items and asked for payment. ""6 dollars!"" His face changed slightly, seemingly unsure that such a small piece of chicken costs so much. Our chicken wings sell for 2 dollars, and comparable to the paltry drumstick.

He paid up anyway, and i feared for his well-being. Will he choke on the dry meat. I was afraid that he would return his item, for being tasteless, and I will have to reheat and display it again. He didnt, and I was so happy with the sale that I can't wait to share it here. Yes! I had finally sold 1 of the dreaded drumsticks!

TL:DR sold drumstick to unfortunate customer",I finally sold it!

I have been rejected by every woman I asked out which are all singaporean. I was abused as a child. Every day I think why the fuck do I have to serve when all I want is to make money and fuck off from this country.

I figured the only thing that would bring out the real feelings of NSFs was to take up the role of an encik and spout the nonsense NS uses to brainwash people or to shut them down. Circular arguments someone pointed out. 

In the end I am glad and hopeful with the amount of people against NS and I hope some seeds of doubt have been planted and will continue to sprout.

It shows the motivation our enciks give is no different than what a robot can generate and it's just bullshit since I was able to spout it.

singapore,"Just putting it out here for honest thoughts an opinions.

TLDR: you live life for yourself eventually and you exist to be happy, our parents will grow old and be unable to take care of themselves one day and you can't possibly be at their side all the time until you are in your 50s. Putting them in a nursing home until they die is a reality in order for you to be free and make use of your youth that is slowly wasting away. How do you face this reality?


Okay just want to put it here, I, like many of us have dreams to venture out and be the best of ourselves, some like to travel the world while others are thinking of starting a family or a business but the thing is that our parents who have always loved us and brought us up with sweat and tears won't live forever. That is the reality that we have to face. 

The thing is, we all deserve the right to seek happiness for ourselves and though there are definitely cases of people being fully happy in taking care of their parents until they die, such cases do not apply to most of us. The thing is that by the time we are in our late 30s, it would be a crucial time for both out careers as well as the starting of our new family with your spouse. Your spouse and children need you and time is limited. With this limited time on earth, it should be spent with them as they are your world. 

For others with no families, it might be a new venture or a new place to migrate to and often the case their migration laws don't apply to your parents. 

You can preach as many morals or wonderful stories as you want but the harsh reality is that we do not have the time, energy or skills to take care of our elderly parents when they reach a stage where they can't take care of themselves, Alzheimers, dementia etc. That putting them in a nursing home till they die is the only way out. 

The thing is this, your parents already had their chance at happiness they had you and they watched you grow up to be successful , it is wrong for them to sap out your time and energy from your life for the sake of filial piety and obedience. It's not as if you've always abandoned them anyway, you've lived about 35+ years of your life with them already anyway. 

I find it hard to sit on the thought that if I were to take care of them myself, it would be 20 years of my adult life that I would never get back and by the time they pass I would be middle aged and I would be regretful at all the experiences I would have went through if I chose to put them in a home instead. 

Of course your aunties and uncles would advise against them but we need to understand that we all have our lives to live happily and if something is obstructing our happiness we need to make changes. We can't say ""oh, too bad lor"" , those years wasted are never coming back.","Honestly, how do you reconcile the reality that you would have to put your parents in a nursing home till they die as you realize your personal happiness is your utmost priority"

3. Burgers are decent, while it won't blow minds, it doesn't pale in comparison with McDonald's burgers at all.

Okay! Here's a reworked version of the first episode of ""Modern Family"" set in Singapore, with actual Singaporean locations, common Singaporean names, and Singlish used in both narration and conversations:

Title: ""Pilot""

Fade in:

INT. TAN JIE'S CONDO IN ORCHARD - DAY

The camera pans over the living room, showing Tan Jie, a wealthy and successful businessman, sitting on his couch, reading a newspaper. The sound of chatter and laughter can be heard from outside.

Tan Jie (narrating in Singlish): Family gatherings always give me a headache, but this time it's going to be a good one lah.

Cut to:

EXT. TAN JIE'S CONDO IN ORCHARD - DAY

The camera shows the exterior of Tan Jie's condo, which is located in the heart of Orchard Road. Family members are arriving and entering the building.

Cut to:

INT. TAN JIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Tan Jie greets the family members as they enter.

Tan Jie: Hey, welcome everyone!

The family members greet Tan Jie in return and continue to chat and catch up with each other.

Cut to:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Gloria, Tan Jie's second wife, is in the kitchen, preparing food. Manny, her son from a previous marriage, is helping her.

Gloria: Hey, Manny, go see if Tan Jie wants anything k?

Manny: Okay, Mama.

Manny exits the kitchen and heads to the living room.

Cut to:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Manny approaches Tan Jie, who is still sitting on the couch.

Manny: Uncle Tan Jie, you want anything?

Tan Jie: No, I'm good, Manny. Thanks.

Manny nods and walks away, but not before shooting a wistful look back at Tan Jie.

Cut to:

INT. CLAIRE AND PHIL'S HDB FLAT IN ANG MO KIO - DAY

Claire, Tan Jie's daughter, and Phil, her husband, are getting ready for the family gathering.

Claire: Okay, we're almost ready. Phil, you got everything?

Phil: Yep, got the kids, got the snacks, got the jokes. Let's go lah!

Claire and Phil gather their children and head out the door.

Cut to:

INT. MITCHELL AND CAMERON'S CONDO IN TANJONG PAGAR - DAY

Mitchell and Cameron, Tan Jie's son and his partner, are also getting ready for the family gathering.

Mitchell: Okay, I've got the fruit salad and Cameron's got the char siew bao. Let's go!

Cameron holds up the bag of char siew bao, which has a cartoon picture of a smiling pig on the front.

Cameron: Who says bao can't be cute?

Mitchell and Cameron exit their condo and head to Tan Jie's house.

Cut to:

INT. TAN JIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The entire family is now gathered in Tan Jie's living room. They are chatting, eating, and enjoying each other","I asked ChatGPT to make a ""Modern Family"" Script based on Singapore"

singapore,"Honestly, I am really okay with the fact that my family is pro-China (and conversely, VERY anti-US/UK) as long as it doesn’t affect my way of life. However, that is simply not the case.

Just to show the extent of my family’s legitimately undying love for China patriotism, my mother plays this pro-China Taiwan talkshow 24/7. I am not kidding or exaggerating in anyway when I say she plays it at home while doing chores/relaxing at home/EVEN WHILE SLEEPING. Everyday when I wake up for work I have to turn off the TV which still plays snippets from this particular talkshow. 

This is still fine, until you realise that she is extremely protective and sensitive of China’s supremacy. When I mentioned that I am not too keen to go to China for holiday, she got really angry and started saying that China is the best in everything. When I talk about furthering my studies in the Western hemisphere, I am met with severe backlash. Literally, every time when China/US/UK/Ukraine/Taiwan (If you wish to call it a country, to each their own) is mentioned in any way, she begins this spiralling rant about how China is the best. Even if I am careful and decide not to talk about these politicised issues, she WILL initiate and bring it up to me, expecting me to agree with her ideals. Truth be told, I just don’t know enough and I don’t want to make rash statements. My father also possesses the same issues, and the two of them form a large echo chamber. To be honest, I am fine with that because minimally they wouldn’t bother me then.

I feel very estranged from my parents because they now take on the role of armchair political commentators and they expect me to agree with every word they say. I feel very tired about how our conly conversation point is literally about politics. I often avoid talking to them because I don’t want to deal with their sometimes very hateful comments. It also seems that their passion for China will intervene in much of my future planning. They want me to study in beida, which I don’t plan to. 

Very clueless now, not sure of what steps I should take from now on.",Living in a VERY pro-Chinese family
singapore,"Happened a couple months ago. The only reason I buy kfc is for their cheese fries, but their quality of fries have seriously dropped.

This new batch of fries has a bitter taste (which probably means undercooked &amp; fryers aren't adapted to them) &amp; are always soggy. The previous batch had a better potato taste &amp; was always crispy.

At least they didn't change the cheese sauce or the mashed potatoes. Seriously disappointed.",Anyone noticed that KFC changed their fries?

singapore,"Ms. Tin served as CEO of Business China from 21st May 2018 until about two months ago according to CNA. Before her, Sun Xueling was the CEO.

A link to the nonprofit can be found here: [https://businesschina.org.sg](https://businesschina.org.sg/en-us/annual-reports/).

The annual reports of the organisation can be found on their website at : [https://businesschina.org.sg/en-us/annual-reports/](https://businesschina.org.sg/en-us/annual-reports/)

I came across the 2021 Annual Report of Business China. It looks like the directorships are held by mostly PAP MPs.

Here are some things I gathered from spending \~20 minutes reading the Annual Report:

Business China was founded by LKY.

**Total Income for the Year: $4.76 million.**

**Total Expenses for the Year: $4.32 million.**

By far, the two largest sources of income of Business China were Donations ($1.90m) *(Note 15)* and Grant Income ($1.84m) *(Note 16)*. The largest grant income comes from the Tote Board - $1.73 million.

&amp;#x200B;

***(Note 20):*** **Staff Costs - 2021: $2.13 million. (\~49.3% of total expenses)**

Staff costs relating to Key Management Personnel amounted to $1.32 million. (\~27.7% of total expenses)

Key Management Personnel remunerations are disclosed in bands. Out of which:

· 6 were paid up to $100,000 each.

· 4 were paid from $100k to $200k each.

· 1 was paid from $200k to $300k. *(Presumably this is Ms. Tin?)*

***(Note 21):*** Resources Expended on Activities - 2021: $1.48 million. (\~ 34.3% of total expenses)  
NB: This is a separate line item from aforementioned Staff Costs. There is no overlapping expense.

The largest expense in this category is on ""Business leaders' engagement and activities"" - $1.00m.

Traveling through some privileged landed property neighborhoods are so frustrating. A lot of car owners choose to park their vehicles on the shared roadside instead of inside their homes. The parking space inside their homes are used for plants, decors etc instead.

These cars are perpetually obstructing traffic flow especially for single vehicle lanes. Large vehicles such as school buses, trucks etc need to zigzag through these parked cars cautiously. I have also seen a several incidents of road rage as opposing drivers refuse to give way.

I wish the authorities would review and potentially bar vehicles from parking on narrow single lane roads and improve the traffic flow.

singapore,"Recently there have been numerous debates about the affordability of HDB, most likely stemming from the high resale price published in the newspaper.

However, why garment never stop to think about the high resale price is primarily due to couples not willing to wait 3 to 5 years for BTO? It is a long wait, there isn't many years for young adults. Due to NS, male tend to finish their university at around 24 or 25 and for female around 22 or 23. Asking young adults to wait many years for BTO is a very difficult thing to do. Especially when having a house of their own signify the start of their new life.

BTO is a reactive approach towards housing needs with goal to not overburden the financial of the country, especially during financial crisis. However, is such approach really suitable for singapore, evidently with people who not willing to wait thus willing to buy houses at high price?

Registration for Flats System (RFS) scheme was the system we used before BTO is introduced. RFS is a pro-active approach to build flat ahead by predicting demands but due to financial crisis in 1997, the demand for housing dropped with oversupply thus BTO is introduced in 2001. Today, BTO evidently is incapable of keeping up with demands thus shouldn't we consider reinstating a revised RFS scheme?

We could run RFS and BTO parallel where RFS build ahead with like maybe 33% of the predicted demands then price it such that BTO is lower than RFS. This can better satisfy the needs of different applicants, those who are well off or can't wait can apply for RFS while those who are less well off or can wait will apply for BTO. This also can reduce the chance of overburdening the financial system in the event of financial crisis while also satisfying the needs of the different populations.",Why garment don't want to review their BTO concept?

Example 1: Had dinner with a couple who just bought their first home. They shared what their house hunting journey was like - in short it came down to 2 options, A and B. They themselves acknowledged that A is a better deal for around the same price as B, and yet they went with B. I asked why, and they said they asked God in their prayers to help decide and God spoke to them to buy B. Not only did they not question this ""voice"", but seemed really happy and amped up that THE authority aided them with such a huge life decision.

Example 2: A colleague was in a customer-facing role with a large institution, so there are clear company SOPs and KPIs. One day a customer she was serving angrily demanded to speak to the manager. Turns out that not only did the colleague not help the customer with his problem, but claimed his problem stemmed from not being a believer in God and even tried to evangelize him. Obviously the manager had to apologise and cover all that shit. When questioned why she acted like that, she said she heard God instructing her to save a person who matched the disgruntled customer's description.

Am I the only one seeing more and more of such people lately?

singapore,"Hello :) I need some advice on tax planning.

Background: I'm Singaporean (have family and grew up here) but have been living and working in Europe for the past few years. I have grown tired of paying the very high taxes in Europe. Recently I found a job that allows me to work entirely remotely. It is US-based, but has employees across US and Europe. The boss is very nice and flexible, and i'm thinking of asking if I could move my contract to Singapore so that I can pay lower taxes and also start filling up my CPF account. However because of the time zone my team operate in, I plan to still spend most of my time (up to 11 months) in Europe.

My 2 questions:

If I were to spend 3-4 months in 3 different European countries (on tourist visa), will I be able to avoid triggering the general 183-day tax residency rule? I know it's ethically ambiguous :/ How easy is it to get caught; is it illegal/ considered tax evasion? By having my family, citizenship and work contract in Singapore, will I able to argue that my tax residency is in Singapore, even though I'll probably spend only a month out of a year in Singapore?

What are some options i can go to my employer with if he doesn't intend to set up a subsidiary in Singapore? How easy is it to set up my own company and bill them as a contractor? Or maybe I could suggest using Remote (a platform that helps companies manage a remote workforce)? Anyone has any experience with that?

I'm posting here to get some initial advice to then go to a tax consultant for a more concrete plan. Should I eventually be speaking with a tax consultant or tax lawyer? Also open to recommendations/ referrals 😊

singapore,"For 20+ years the Singapore Malay/Muslim community is successful in countering extremist ideology. Measures include licensing/regulation for asatizahs (teachers of Islam) + sermons/material to clarify misconceptions + religious counselling for radicalised Muslim Singaporeans + looking out for those at risk. That is why Singapore not yet kena terrorist attack compared to the communist threat in 1960s.

I think this success made Singaporeans complacent about extremist ideology which can also come from other groups:

* Many Christians in Singapore kena influenced by Trump like ideology (like the Indian boy who plan to attack mosques).
* Many traditional Chinese in Singapore kena brainwashed by China propaganda.
* Some liberal Singaporeans (usually with more economic privilege) are becoming more radical and polarising.
* Some Malay/Muslim Singaporeans are getting tired of community efforts to counter extremist ideology. More are feeling alienated from wider Singapore society.

There are many possible factors for the slight increase in extremist ideology in Singapore:

* Impact of pandemic on Singapore society + social cohesion. For example, increase in racism against Chinese in 2020 then Indians during Delta. Many elderly forced to rely on digital media despite limited technical skills + limited media literacy (easily misled by fake news).
* Impact of pandemic + inflation (also housing crisis) pushed many poor families to breaking point. To see rich Westernised Singaporeans enjoying life + elitism rubs salt into the wounds.
* Extremist recruiters/influencers become smarter to use same psychology tricks as scammers + take advantage of existing fault lines in our society (like language barriers) + target most vulnerable.
* Extremism from any group adds to mistrust/insecurity in other groups which can add to extremism in other groups leading to a vicious cycle/multiplier effect (not sure of correct term).

Only a small percentage of Singaporeans believe in extremist ideology and among them only a small percentage will resort to violence. But if the above trends multiply the small percentage by 3 (example number) that can be the difference leading to hate crimes/first successful terrorist attack.

True stories of two people I know who are affected by extremist ideology (details vague to protect identities):

* A close friend from secondary school + his family are traditional Chinese but when they invite me to their place they serve halal food + his parents (Chinese educated with limited English) talk to me in Malay. During Covid his parents start to use Chinese social media a lot for news/music/movies + buy cheap stuff. His mother passed away due to Covid. While he + family are greiving (so burning more but still try to be responsible) kena conflict with another Chinese family over their burning. Then got financial/legal stuff to settle (like insurance/will) but the father don't know how (all in English) and tried to get help on Chinese social media. The father read a lot of China propaganda then kena brainwashed. He keeps telling his children he would support China to attack Singapore to kill all the jiak kantang Singaporeans who want to destroy Chinese culture + keep traditional Chinese Singaporeans in poverty. Even asked my friend to shoot jiak kantang Singaporeans during NS. Friend/siblings don't want to report him because he was a great father for many years + they scared they kena starved if he kena arrested.
* A cousin (we grew up together) with special needs who is intelligent but naive + quiet. Pandemic dashed his family's (and mine) hopes of escaping poverty (his therapy also kena disrupted). He recently completed mainstream education (kena bullied a lot) but struggling to find job due to poor economy + racial discrimination + special needs challenges. He spends most of the time on the computer. Few months ago he shared in family Whatsapp group screenshots of LGBT supporters here insulting people who oppose LGBT rights as retarded + comparing them to ISIS.  When I found out he surfs a lot of extremist material I told his mother but she said better not report. She thinks with his condition he is not able to carry out any attack + police will not be able to handle him properly. She will try to find an asatizah familiar with special needs to talk to him but is not high priority compared to day to day economic survival.

Hope we can take the threat seriously + have a rationale discussion about how to counter extremist ideology.",Singaporeans are getting complacent about risk of extremism

Malaysia has made a proposal for a ""single clearance system"" to address traffic congestion at the Johor Causeway's land checkpoint.

According to the Star, immigration clearance will only be conducted once on either side of the border.

“This means Singapore's immigration will be stationed at our checkpoints in Johor to clear people entering the republic, while Malaysian immigration will be deployed in Singapore to clear those entering Malaysia,"" Johor transportation committee chairman Mohamad Fazli said. 

This will be similar to the system that will be used when the Rapid Transit System operations begin in 2026,” Fazli told The Star.

He claimed the majority of commuters had to get up at 4am to queue at the JB checkpoint by 5am to get through traffic and return late at night.",New way to ease traffic across Causeway

The annual reports of the organisation can be found on their website at : [https://businesschina.org.sg/en-us/annual-reports/](https://businesschina.org.sg/en-us/annual-reports/)

I came across the 2021 Annual Report of Business China. It looks like the directorships are held by mostly PAP MPs.

Here are some things I gathered from spending \~20 minutes reading the Annual Report:

**Total Income for the Year: $4.76 million.**

**Total Expenses for the Year: $4.32 million.**

By far, the two largest sources of income of Business China were Donations ($1.90m) *(Note 15)* and Grant Income ($1.84m) *(Note 16)*. The largest grant income comes from the Tote Board - $1.73 million.

***(Note 20):*** **Staff Costs - 2021: $2.13 million. (\~49.3% of total expenses)**

Staff costs relating to Key Management Personnel amounted to $1.32 million. (\~27.7% of total expenses)

Key Management Personnel remunerations are disclosed in bands. Out of which:

* 6 were paid up to $100,000 each.
* 4 were paid from $100k to $200k.
* 1 was paid from $200k to $300k.

***(Note 21):*** **Resources Expended on Activities - 2021: $1.48 million. (\~ 34.3% of total expenses)**  
NB: This is a separate line item from aforementioned Staff Costs. There is no overlapping expense.

The largest expense in this category is on ""Business leaders' engagement and activities"" - $1.00m.","Prior to joining Grab, Ms Tin Pei Ling was CEO of Business China, a nonprofit dedicated to cultivating Singapore-China relationships."

singapore,"My parents have received an email from CPF asking to repay the lump sum of my uni fees in 14 days or legal action will be taken. 

My understanding is that CPF would have sent me a hardcopy letter informing me to start repayment 1 year after I graduated. But I never received such a letter. 

I graduated in July 2021 and I should’ve received a letter sometime in 2022 but never did. 

If they sent me an email, unfortunately it was sent to a defunct email account I used during my Poly days. The first time I held a job was during poly and I logged in to CPF, set my school email as the contact details (which is stupid I know, but what do you know about CPF and notifications when you’re 17?). 

Never knew that we had to manually update our contact details on CPF website. Thought everything was synced centrally through SingPass. 

A google search of “CPF education loan notification” states: 
&gt; 13 Aug 2021 — We will send a repayment letter to you to inform you to start repayment. It will state the outstanding CPF education loan amount, the date ...

But on the latest live site, it has since been changed from “letter” to “notification”. 

Probably have to pay extra 2 years of interest because CPF decided to stop sending paper mail for important stuff like this, and didn’t sync their system with SingPass.",CPF education loan default - additional 2 years of interest for nothing?

singapore,"To Singaporeans who wants to ""eat the rich"", 

Your enemy aren’t bankers/lawyers/doctors. The ones earning $150-250k a year are not your enemies. We are after all, employees, who exchange our expertise and time for salary. Yes, their salaries are higher than most people, but its not high enough to cause a dent in society. They are not the ones buying multiple properties left and right, causing property prices to increase (also, the current property price rise is due to low supply, not exceptionally high demand). They are not the ones making your lives miserable. 

Your enemy is the ultra rich, with over $25 million in investable assets aka cash. When u increase tax rates to tax the rich, you’re hurting the bankers and lawyers, who ultimately still earn an honest living. Because while they have higher income, its still not enough for them to go through tax loopholes. The ultra rich will never pay the taxes if you increase it to a point where its no longer worth it for them, they will simply leave. When there are mass exodus of the rich, Singaporeans suffer. Singaporeans suffer because tax revenue will drop, so less subsidies from the government that benefits the poor. Singaporeans will also suffer because jobs will be moved to another country. This is not what you want. 

If you truly want to ""eat the rich"", you have to understand that the government has the same objective as you in mind. The government, too, wants to squeeze more money out of the rich. But the way the government do it is more subtle and nuanced. The govt has to balance between increasing tax revenues, while also keeping their companies here. Its a difficult balancing act that the government has managed to do well for a really long time.","To the ""eat-the-rich"" crowd of Singapore..."

It stinks. Just to mention, i don't have any smelly feet issues. Worn for a day, stench is fine and light. After few days, the stench grows. It gets way worse when it's wet and it doesn't dry quickly due to the paracord material. I'm not too sure what material is causing the stench though, maybe the rubber? The stench temporary disappears once it's fully dried and comes back once you start using it again. True that it's only nice for aesthetics purposes and my flatfeet is actually feeling a little support from the arch. 

So yes. I haven't really seen any reviews talking about the stench it causes. Wondering if i'm the only one experiencing the same?",PSA: Will not recommend people purchasing Keen's Uneek sandals

singapore,"So, I made a comment a few weeks ago that was downvoted on r/NationalServiceSG \- because the premise basically was “Allowances don’t have to be raised just yet in light of the upcoming recession and financial situation”, something which I do still agree with to a certain extent. I had a sleepless night, woke up and went on a bit of a tangent to consider: \*how much would an increase in allowance actually cost?\* Let’s assume now that we are only adjusting Allowances to adjust to inflation rates, rather than dealing with the issue of how ethical being underpaid in allowances is.

We must note here that for the sake of clarity that I’m not an Economist, Statist nor Political Analyst, and that many of these calculations are estimates. While my opinion will clearly be rather one-sided based on these numbers, I do think that the approach to these calculations can very clearly be flawed, and while I provide a little of my own opined commentary these are amateur observations and may not be as insightful as I wish. Lastly: opposing opinions are welcomed. While where I’ll post this is likely to very much support these findings, there are very much valid places to nitpick or oppose the way I’ve approached these statistics.

**Inflation Rates, and (Proposed) Pay Rises:**

Pay and allowance should always be allowed to match Inflation, to allow NSFs to afford the necessities and luxuries allowed to them “in recognition of (their) contributions” (CMPB). A good estimate of a warranted increase in NSF pay would be to follow inflation rates, of which have been rather high by SG standards with the onset of the pandemic.

Inflation Rates in 2021 and 2022 respectively were 2.3% and 6.7%, which isn’t really too bad considering COVID and the overall world financial situation. A rise of 7%, which I believe is a pretty realistic sentiment, would be a rise from \*SGD630\* to SGD674.10 for the lowest possible allowance allocated - to standardise everything, let’s just assume a $50 pay rise for all NSFs regardless of rank and vocation.

**Number of NSFs and Total Cost:**

Wikipedia notes that an average of 50,000 people serve NS annually - a number which isn’t really realistic, considering Resident Live Births per Singstat indicate 38,000-39,000 Singaporean Babies were born in 2001 and 2002 annually, falling to about \~35,000 p.a in 2003-2005. Halve these numbers for Males only, and being generous enough to round up, 18,500 Singaporean men at birth will enter NS annually. Add another 3,400 new citizens per year serving NS (Source: ST) and rounding up, we get 22,000 Singaporean men serving per year. Doubling that to highlight the total NSFs that would be in service this year, and throwing on some extras for good measure, *45,000 NSFs* would benefit from this pay rise as a super-rough ballpark estimate.

Okay, basic maths would indicate that a rise in pay rates would be \~ 50 x 45,000 per month, which would be 2.25 mil per month higher spending, and *27 mil per year* additional financial pressure on the Military budget. That’s… pretty expensive, but let’s take a look at comparative figures.

**(A few) Comparative Figures:**

* Janes’ (A Military Journalism organization) notes that the SAF had an SGD 1 Billion rise in their budget from 2021 to 2022, to SGD 16.36 Billion, a 6.5% increase. This was attributed to, among other things, “higher construction requirements, including projects previously delayed by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic”, and “modernisation plans laid out by the government in 2019… delayed by Covid-19”. With some back of the envelope cost calculations (SEE COST BREAKDOWN HERE), the SAF spends a ballpark figure of around $455 Million per year on NSF pay. NSF pay thus makes up approximately 2.7-2.8% of the Singapore military budget. For comparison, the 27 mil increase would, well, comprise 2.7% of the $1Bil increase attributed to the SAF. Such an increase would thus be perfectly in line with the budgetary increases of the SAF.
* In 2022, “about 23,000 civil servants will get a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 14 per cent from Aug 1 (in 2022)” (source: ST), “exceed(ing) Singapore’s core inflation rate of 5.1 per cent” (CNA). The main reasons for these pay rises were due to the competitive pay rises in the Private sector, while offsetting the rising cost of living due to inflation.
* The GST hike, another reason for the increase in living costs, is likely to bring in an additional SGD 3.5 Billion p.a. by the full increase in 2024. A 27mil yearly increase for NSFs would make up approximately 0.77% of that annual budget increase.

From an economic standpoint, I find it hard to justify not increasing NSF pay in light of budgetary and economic conditions. NSF allowances are small relative to the comparative private sector pay expectations - wage-driven inflation should not be a concerning factor given that wages have increased everywhere in Singapore. Even considering that NSF pay could be a “privilege”, it can’t be overstated that with increases in living costs across the board - even in basic necessities such as transport and food - that this expected and thus essential source of income for NSFs should keep up with rising prices. If anything - should NSFs be paid only allowances due to our services being “crucial to the nation”, shouldn’t this minimal allowance be the first to increase, since it’s already the minimum expected to live on given our circumstances?

If NSFs are to be at the forefront of the Nation’s defense, and expected to serve in light and despite of the challenges introduced by COVID and the economic and political turmoils over the past few years - they should be compensated at \*least\* to the same comparative standards as NSFs of years before. Even if NS “cannot be measured by dollars and cents” - bus fares, Big Macs and Butter rolls all are, and the prices of those are burning holes in our pockets.

(If I remember correctly) This pathway was first introduced in 2020 when all the autonomous unis started offering spots to adult learners who fit the criteria. Said criteria: (I) 25 years old and above as of 1 July of matriculating year, (II) have 4 years of work experience, (III) SG / PR citizen, (IV) does not have a prior degree studied/read.

I applied in 2021 to: [SUSS](https://www.suss.edu.sg/full-time-undergraduate/admissions/eligibility), [SIT](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/adult-learners), [NUS](https://scale.nus.edu.sg/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/AdvanceNUS) and [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admission-guide/adult-learners-scheme). I did not apply to [SMU](https://admissions.smu.edu.sg/programmes/smu-higher-education-pathway-adult-learners-heal), but they also do have their higher education pathway. Respective unis' adult learner pathways are called differently. Results: Was put on reserve for SUSS but eventually rejected, SIT and NUS rejected me too. Only NTU accepted me :')

Other than the usual admin application process, here are the individual interview process:

SUSS: zoom group interview with other applicants (probably fresh grad poly/JC).

SIT, NUS: no interview

NTU: Online recorded interview. 6 general admission interview questions, 4 where they will record you, and 2 written. For the recorded questions, they will flash out the question, give u some seconds to think and they will start recording. You have 2 takes for each question. Can't really remember what they asked, but one of the questions was I think why the 6 choices and why in that order. Other questions IIRC are other behavioural type questions.

Here's my timeline for NTU: 

Jan? or Feb 21: Submitted application

7 May 2021: received email to do an online interview, 13 May 2021 deadline

21 May 2021: received email saying I'm successful in my application for one of my choices 

Here's the big reveal LOL: 

I took pharmaceutical sciences from NYP and worked in a govt hosp as a pharm tech for 5 years (as a millennial I think it's a bit surprising that I managed to stay at a toxic job for so long, didn't chg job cos got comfortable but at the same time I felt like I wanted to upskill so here we are folks). In those 5 years, boss saw potential in me and sent me for Advanced diploma in pharmaceutical sciences. After serving my bond I was like..... what's next? I kind of knew deep down I only wanted to stop studying once I obtained at least a degree..... so yeah just nice I turned 25 in 2020 but because my birthday is in August..... :'))))) BUT ITS FINE I got accepted and that's all that matters

My gpa in poly was...... 3.05..... y'all.............. if anyone has the same gpa, y'all can try applying!!! hahaha

Some advice:

(i) For NTU, please ONLY apply to SINGLE DEGREES. For all 6 choices. I did the mistake of putting double major...... lol

Also, I put my first 3 choices as biological sciences, thinking there's a higher chance that I would be accepted, and biz in the rest of my choices cos I felt that it's a course that would be easier to transition to from another diploma course. just FYI

(ii) NUS requires you to give your latest CPF statement or payslip I think? also, NUS makes it compulsory for you to put your 2 referees and they have to be supervisors from your current workplace

(iii) IIRC SMU requires you to submit personal statement. rest of unis don't have

Qns I have received from other Redditors before:

1. Does NTU ALS restrict the degrees that you apply for, depending on your diploma? - I guess not? I transitioned from a pharmacy diploma to a business degree. Though I think some O level subjects would help for some courses... like maybe Amath, POA, pure Geog, Pure sci, etc.
2. What was your GPA? - 3.05
3. Course intake for each year? - idk hahaha but from the news, autonomous unis have now started giving [more spots](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/working-adults-may-get-more-opportunities-pursue-degrees-moe-funded-programmes-2544086) to adult learners !! what yall waiting for
4. Do you get a class with other adult learners, or combined with the normal students? - combined. Think the adult learner intake is not that many for them to cater a specialised class for adult learners hahaha don't worry though, if you enter in the late 20s, you'll blend in pretty well.
5. Do you click well with your peers? - Actually yes. Don't have to reveal your age or that you are an adult learner. Only tell when you're comfortable with it :) from my experience, I only reveal it to some of my groupmates... and don't think so much about how they are 6/7 years younger and you'll be fine.... HAHAHA
6. Is there any fellow adult learners in your class or cohort? - have yet to meet any.... so yeah you can roughly gauge how ""rare"" I am
7. How are you coping after a 4 year break from school? -  Lmao this question is 💯 hahha I mean I guess I’m doing ok, not too bad but not too good either, just floating and trying to survive. I feel like I’m an oldie cos my peers can sleep late and wake up early but I guess my body needs/want that 8 hours of sleep….. so ya as long as you know your limits……. just live in the moment and you’ll do fine too 👍🏻 
8. If I overload, can I graduate earlier? - for ntu I don't think you can overload........ you'd have to write in why you want to overload and you also somewhat need to prove that you can do well albeit overloading.... which means you have to I guess get FCH in y1s1? 
9. Are we able to apply for financial aid like other students? - yes

In fact, he specifically moved from AMK to Timah and signed up for the volunteering stuff to buff up his signalling ability for his kid's school admission, similar to what we do in Uni for internships/CCAs.

For context, he is doing well in life now, having gotten his masters in Harvard law on a G scholarship eons ago. In my mind, there is nothing wrong for the parent to want the best for his kid, be it getting into good schools, the best tuition/enrichment classes etc. Yet, you have to wonder if the individual pursuit of optimality will lead to socially efficient outcomes.

Granted, we do have a litany of social assistance schemes to help the disadvantaged class catch up (e.g. CDAC, MOE FAS, Mendaki). But, and this has probably been said before, I can't help feel that social mobility has diminished since the previous study done in 2012 (see [here](https://www.mof.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/news-and-publications/featured-reports/ig-income-mobility-in-spore.pdf?sfvrsn=5f0bc606_14)). (There is also an interesting idea on the over-production of elites which paves the way for more instability via [class struggles](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237458)). Given how MTI siphons some of the best/brightest microeconomists into the ES, I can't believe there was no policy evaluation done on these schemes in terms of their substance and delivery.

Not exactly a question here but I just wonder if there is a final destination for meritocracy x inequality, particularly as we head down the road of wealth management. Then you look at the rise and rise of asset prices (COE, real estate) and question how things will pan out in the coming years",Meritocracy (and its discontents?)

singapore,"I am currently an O-Level student waiting for my posting, and am currently working part-time at this beautiful bar/restaurant. However, I’ve not been enjoying work because of one employee, let’s call him A. Whenever I walk into the restaurant to put my stuff down and get properly dressed to start work, the first thing he always asks, in a demanding tone, is “Did you bring anything for me?” I did not know what it meant so I just casually said no. However, he would always get riled up and complain about how I keep eating the restaurant’s food (given to me during my break) and that he never gets anything in return. It was only last week when I was waiting for a taxi to return home (it was 1am) when another co-worker mentioned that the said phrase meant bringing him food.

A also constantly shouts at me to get my attention and if I accidentally did something wrong (in front of him), he would hit me on the shoulder. Hard.

His presence already makes me uncomfortable and the restaurant being (slightly) understaffed means that I will have to mingle with him a lot.

What should I do? Would this be classified under workplace abuse? I’m going back to work next week and I’m not looking forward to it at all, all because of A. I’m afraid that bringing up this issue will only aggravate him even more.",In need of advice

singapore,"This discussion is open to fellow redditors who frequently use dual loop feeder services, as well as bus enthusiasts with any insight into this matter.

For context, dual loop feeder services, formerly known as Townlink (SBST/Go-Ahead) or Intra-Town (SMRT) services, provide direct connections between various neighbourhoods within a residential estate without the need for transferring between buses or the MRT/LRT. Such feeder services typically serve the bus interchange / town centre bus stop twice along their journeys, functioning as both a feeder service between neighbourhood(s) and the town centre, and connecting different neighbourhoods within a town together. There are currently 10 dual loop feeder services operating in Ang Mo Kio (265, 268), Bedok (222), Choa Chu Kang (307), Pasir Ris (358, 359), Tampines (291, 293), Woodlands (911, 912, 913) and Yishun (811, 812). In addition, 381, introduced in 2017, is also a dual loop feeder service, connecting Punggol West (N2) with Punggol East (N1), but was never officially designated as a dual loop feeder service by LTA.

In old newspaper archives, the launch of Townlink/Intra-Town services were marketed by SBS/TIBS to ""improve intra-town links between neighbourhoods within an estate"" and ""reducing the hassle of transferring between buses to travel between neighbourhoods"". Some incentives, such as cheaper fares compared to transferring between 2 feeder buses, and the deployment of air-con buses (at a time when feeder services exclusively used non-air-con buses), were also promoted in these articles, both of which have become obsolete with the launch of distance fares in 2010 and a fully air-con bus fleet from 2013.

While dual loop feeder services may have been useful when first introduced, are they still relevant today? Here are several issues that come with the operation of such feeder services:

**1) Travel Time**

Today, travel time is a key factor when commuters decide on the travel options to get from 1 place to another. While some commuters may prefer a direct bus between their destinations, there are others who may opt to transfer between buses and/or the MRT/LRT, if they're able to get to their destinations faster. In fact, the LTA has made transferring between buses and MRT/LRT more lucrative, with the introduction of distance fares in 2010, which calculates fares based on the overall distance travelled by commuters on public transport rather than on a single bus/train ride.

Thus, commuters may be more incentivised to transfer between buses or take the MRT/LRT to get from 1 neighbourhood to another today if they're able to reach their destination faster, rather than taking a dual loop feeder service, which may incur more travel time.

For instance, 811 provides a direct link between Chong Pang and Yishun Ring Rd, but takes a huge detour via Yishun Ave 6 before proceeding to Yishun South. On the other hand, taking 171/856/859 and transferring to 807/860 at Yishun Interchange to get to Yishun Ring Rd is faster, since 171/856/859 take a direct route via Ave 5, and 807/860 take a direct route via Ring Rd. While it may be slightly more expensive to transfer between buses than taking a dual loop feeder service, some commuters may be willing to pay more, if it means they can get to their destinations quicker.

**2) Reliability**

As with long distance trunk services, dual loop feeder services tend to be more prone to reliability issues than regular feeder services. When the Peak Period Short Service (PPSS) scheme was launched by LTA in 2014, 11 of the 14 PPSS were aimed at complementing dual loop feeder services.

In 2017, LTA took it a step further by rationalising 75% of the trips operated on Intra-Town 912, splitting them into single loop trips numbered ""A"" and ""B"", due to the extended unreliability of the service, despite having 912P (later 912M) to supplement the West loop for over 3 years. While this may have improved reliability on the service, more buses/drivers had to be deployed on the service, going against LTA's notion of ""optimising limited resources"", given that single loop and dual loop trips often bunched on the service.

Does this imply that dual loop feeder services would've been less able to meet the peak hour frequencies specified by PTC without additional resources from private operators in PPSS, in contrast to regular feeder services?

If LTA had wanted to prioritise improving the reliability of feeder connections (between neighbourhoods and the town centre) over intra-town links (between various neighbourhoods in a town), would it've been better to rationalise dual loop feeder services? This is given that LTA often cites ""the need to optimise limited resources and manpower"" when justifying the rationalisation of parallel trunk services to MRT lines. A similar goal could be achieved if selected dual loop feeder services with lower intra-town demand are completely split back into 2 separate services.

**3) Alternative Intra-Town Options**

Over the 2010s, more travel options have been added to provide intra-town connections within an estate, such as the DTL3 between Tampines East/West. The upcoming CRL1 will also connect Pasir Ris East/West, all of which may duplicate or reduce the demand for dual loop feeder services.

In Yishun, new feeder services were introduced, duplicating segments of neighbourhoods currently served by 811 &amp; 812. In particular, the new 807 provides a faster intra-town link between Yishun East/South and West than 811 by skipping Yishun Ave 6.

While such trials had limited success, on demand buses were introduced to provide direct intra-town travel within Punggol estate, which could be faster than taking a dual loop feeder service.

With the availability of faster and more efficient alternative options for intra-town travel, are dual loop feeder services still lucrative to commuters today?

**4) Suggestions to Improve Dual Loop Feeder Services**

While there are alternative options for some dual loop feeder services today, other dual loop feeder services may still be faster than transferring between buses, such as 265/268 in Ang Mo Kio. Thus, here are some suggestions to improve the efficiency of dual loop feeder services:

a. Dual loop feeder services should be operated as a supplementary link rather than an essential feeder link, if their demand is low. While there are segments of commuters such as students and housewives that use dual loop feeder services for intra-town travel, the majority of commuters are only taking them to the nearest MRT station/bus interchange. As such, frequencies for the feeder connections should be higher than that of the intra-town connections, according to their demand. This does not imply that all dual loop feeder services need to be split back into 2 separate services, or be operated like 912. For instance, trunk services with lower demand can be amended to provide a feeder connection between a neighbourhood and the town centre, which was done with 26 in Chai Chee back in 2016 to complement 222.

b. If possible, dual loop feeder services should be made to skip the town centre/bus interchange when travelling between different neighbourhoods. This will reduce their lengthiness and improve their travel time and reliability. There are currently various trunk services that provide direct intra-town links between neighbourhoods in an estate without passing through the town centre, such as 188 between Bukit Gombak and Bukit Batok West.

Feel free to provide more suggestions or rebut on the points discussed above.",Are dual loop feeder bus services still relevant today?

I am a software engineer and I always felt difficulty in explaining to the elderly in regards to what I do for a living. Also, I felt like they wouldn't be able to understand even if I tried.

Besides, they do not understand English. I have to speak in Chinese, and my Chinese is not that good.

For example, if someone said the term 'software engineer' in Chinese, which is 'Ruan Jian Kai Fa', does that sound over-complicated? I personally find it awkward to say that in Chinese, and they probably have no idea.

Also, I can't help but feel that they are assuming every job to be related to doing labor/physical work, and only respect that kind of job which is kind of annoying tbh.

It's like there's a major disconnection between them and me due to being born in a different era and because of me being in a modern role that is not very prevalent in the past.

singapore,"Some food firms may be using inflation as an excuse to hike prices further than necessary, the chairman of Tesco has said.

Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg if food producers were taking advantage of the poorest in society, John Allan said it was ""entirely possible"".

He said Tesco was trying ""very hard"" to challenge price hikes it thinks are illegitimate.

Food costs including milk and cheese are rising at their fastest since 1977.

Mr Allan said all supermarkets were challenging cost increases from suppliers where they could - and Tesco was confronting companies it believed were increasing prices beyond what was necessary.

""We do try very hard to challenge [price hikes], I think,"" Mr Allan said.

""We have a team who can look at the composition of food, costs of commodities, and work out whether or not these cost increases are legitimate.""

He said it was something Tesco's buying teams were dealing with ""every day of the week"".

Tesco, which has a 27.5% share of the Great Britain grocery market, had ""fallen out"" with ""a number of suppliers"" after ""robust"" discussions over price hikes that the supermarket had challenged, he said.

Most price hikes were legitimate, Mr Allan added.

""There have been some dramatic increases in commodity costs, energy costs and labour costs. On the other hand, if you don't want to pay £1.70p for... soup in Tesco or any other supermarket, there are own-label alternatives,"" he said.

Heinz beans and tomato ketchup were among the products Tesco temporarily removed from shelves last year in a row over pricing. Kraft Heinz said at the time it was becoming more expensive to make its products.

Millions of people continue to struggle with the cost of living which rose steadily as Covid restrictions eased and after Russia launched its assault on Ukraine.

Inflation, which measures the rate of price rises, fell to 10.5% in the year to December from 10.7% in November - but remains at levels not seen for 40 years.

Food prices rose 16.8% in the year to December, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Basics such as milk, cheese and eggs saw the biggest increases. Prices for jam, honey and chocolate also jumped. However, price growth slowed for bread and cereals.

Consumer group Which? has also been tracking how much major retailers have put up their prices compared with their competitors.

Tesco was sixth in the list of supermarkets with the highest price rises, the group said.

Which?'s supermarket food and drink inflation tracker records the annual price rises of tens of thousands of food and drink products across three months at eight major supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl, Waitrose and Ocado.

It found that despite being the cheapest supermarkets overall, Lidl's prices went up the most in December at 21.1% since this time last year, followed closely by Aldi at 20.8%.","Would you believe in NTUC fairprice to make these remarks? : Food firms raising prices unnecessarily, Tesco's John Allan says"

Plus they apparently have over 235 awards for quality and value yet somehow up until a few months ago I have never heard of them.

Although I find meadow's marketing strategy to be aggressive, it is nothing in comparison to Yuu. I do think it's high time for Singapore to move beyond using stereotypical characters like Phua Chu Kang to appeal to consumers, and explore more innovative methods. but that's just me, I'm just sick of hearing the parody songs and seeing Gurmit Singh's face everywhere I turn when I'm looking for white bread.",Rise of Meadows and Yuu

SINGAPORE: The Singapore Food  Agency (SFA) on Friday (Jan 20) issued a recall for the  strawberry-flavoured EGO swiss roll after it was found to exceed the  permitted level of sorbic acid.

The affected batch comes from Malaysia, with a weight of 176g and a best-before date of Sep 3, 2023.

The agency has directed importer Kee Wee Hup Kee Food Manufacture to recall the product as a precaution. The recall is ongoing.

""Sorbic acid is a permitted food additive used for preservation  purposes,"" said SFA. ""Consumption of the affected product is unlikely to  pose any adverse health effect due to its low toxicity.""

However, consumers who have purchased the implicated product and have concerns about their health should not consume it.

They may contact their point of purchase for enquiries, added SFA.

My random thoughts while queuing at flooded CIQ towards Malaysia and also when returning on the empty bus back to Singapore:

Singaporeans should try to unite, at least stop pwning each other.

Global competition is real. Jobs are taken up no matter how lowly paid it seems. Unless 3.25 exchange rate.

PR status means anyone from any country can drive a Singapore registered car, live in HDB, and pass off as a Singaporean and their bad habits along with it.

Lastly, well wishes to Malaysians going back home for CNY. It was hard work earning money in Singapore to bring back home to spend, the daily pushing and grinding across the causeway.

Gotta work during CNY, ""labour shortage issues"". No 1.5x as executive are not covered under MOM labour law. Oh wait, but I can fall sick 😷... But there goes the performance incentive for MC...

Better start booking leave for next year's CNY

singapore,"Food guru KF Seetoh flexed mightily over social media on Monday (Jan 16) after Urban Hawker was named to not one but two “Best of” lists on the Eater NY website.

“You don’t get to be on that well-regarded Hottest New Restn list nor that respected Essential 38 Restn List from Eater that easily. You can’t invite them for food testing and a rating (just like Makansutra),” Mr Seetoh wrote with understandable pride.

He added that Urban Hawker, which had a soft opening on Sept 21, 2022, made it to both lists in less than four months “despite Eater not ranking restaurants with less than 6 mths in the business.”


“I am so frikkin’ proud of our hawkers,” he added. “I salute you all. It is quite a big deal to be loved and acknowledged by New Yorkers.”

The Makansutra founder opened the Singapore-style food court in New York last year, bringing 11 Singapore hawkers to 135 West 50th Street, within walking distance of Times Square in Manhattan.

Urban Hawker is now listed second on Eater’s “The 15 Hottest New Restaurants in Manhattan, January 2023”, which was published earlier this month.

“From conception to completion, this new food court between Times Square and Rockefeller Center took several years — and involved Anthony Bourdain’s input — to try to replicate the feel of a hawker food mall in Singapore. From an eventual collection of vendors, the counters include Hainan Jones (Hainanese chicken, steamed or fried), Mr. Fried Rice (stingray fried rice), and Mamak’s Corner (Indian food as served in Singapore). Oh, and there’s a full bar specializing in gin drinks at the 51st Street entrance,” the caption reads.

On the “The 38 Essential Restaurants in New York City” list, updated on Jan 10, it says that Urban Hawker “may be the city’s liveliest and most unique food court, with a majority of its stalls inspired by — or directly descended from — the street food of Singapore.

Highlights include fragrant Hainanese chicken (either poached or roasted) served with rice and broth at Hainan Jones, coconut-laced cakes and pastries from Lady Wong, and Malaysian-style Indian fare from Mamak’s Corner.”

More recently, the food court was written up in The New York Times.

While critic Pete Wells acknowledged in his Jan 17 piece the areas where Urban Hawker may still improve, he nevertheless called it “a vivid bazaar of Singaporean dishes.”

He also wrote, “What separates Urban Hawker from all the other food halls in New York is that it puts the cooks front and center….",KF Seetoh says ‘I am so frikkin’ proud of our hawkers’ after Urban Hawker gets listed on two ‘best restaurants in NY’ websiteKF Seetoh says ‘I am so frikkin’ proud of our hawkers’ after Urban Hawker gets listed on two ‘best restaurants in NY’ websitev

singapore,"The most disappointing for me was KFC discontinuing their $5 Rice Bowl Value Meal.

https://preview.redd.it/e3tvixfwaxca1.jpg?width=719&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=150c12e9ec00421f8ebd72e894e383c74f74cfb7

It used to be $5 for 1 Rice Bowl (has popcorn chicken, rice, gravy) + Regular Drink + 2-pc tender.

I ordered the same meal in 6th January and it costs $12.80 now since you'll have to order everything ala carte:

1 Rice Bowl = $4.60

1 Regular Drink = $2.90

1 3-pc Tender = $5.30  
\*which means it's $1.77 per tender thus 2 tenders costs $3.53

It doesn't really matter much to me as my colleagues and I have just stopped eating there entirely. Even if I were to really have the meal, it's not a big dent on my budget. But I kind of feel that some lower income families or students might have been avid patrons of their $5 Value Meals too since it was affordable and filling.

I do understand that their $5 Value Meals might have just been a promotional item which is no longer practical for them to continue amid rising costs but I'm just sad as I have been ordering that meal whenever I go there since 2014.",Which other brands have you noticed that have discreetly increased their pricing?

singapore,"I’m a TikTok addict for at least 9 months. I have seen some users posting videos containing someone else in a predicament/vulnerable state, for example: 
- paramedics performing CPR on someone 
- paramedics assessing/attending to someone who fainted, unconscious or injured
- someone who is unconscious and members of public crowding around
- someone lying at the foot of a flight of stairs
- commotions/fights happening on the MRT, bus stop, coffee shop etc
- or the incident where someone was held at knifepoint at Yishun (filming someone at such a precarious situation)
- firefighters saving someone from the building (no fire), inflatable set up 
- police blue tent
- someone unwell and being attended to on the MRT platform 

I particularly don’t understand why someone would film someone who is in a vulnerable situation i.e. being resuscitated or being ill and having to be attended by paramedics in public. 

I’m not familiar with the law. But is there some kind of guidelines about PDPA or respecting someone else’s privacy in public (I know the oxymoron). Even if there is no black and white law to say no filming of someone else, do humans have some kind of empathy or 同理心? 将心比心 (put yourself in someone else’s shoes), if you or your loved ones are in those situations fighting for your life or being sick, do you want to be filmed and have your uncensored face published all over social media? Those videos can garner thousands and thousands of views when it appears on TikTok FYP. Where’s the respect?

What’s more annoying is that they don’t describe what exactly is happening and the comments section are usually flooded with What happened? Where? When? And the creator of the video usually doesn’t respond. Interestingly, the creators tend to be from certain populations (if you know you know, sometimes their phone camera quality cmi) or certain age groups. I always kaypoh and will click to see their profiles because I really wonder what is going on like why would they film such things? 

Is there really a need for such a culture on TikTok? To some extent, it seems insensitive.",What’s with the ‘filming someone in a difficult/unpleasant situation’ culture on TikTok?

singapore,"To preface this, I don't know if anyone will read this but this is my pseudo-rant on my ongoing mental wellness. I feel like a lot of people, even adults, fear getting mental health help due to societal stigma, and with the mental health campaigns by HealthHub plastered everywhere nowadays, I felt like this still is Singapore-related. Sorry if this feels like I'm trauma-dumping, I tried to keep it as clear and concise as possible. 

I was quite severely depressed and had bad intrusive thoughts since I was 15, only getting help early last year by speaking out about my MH struggles and suicidal ideation to a trusted adult. This was because I was scared of being judged by classmates and friends, as I was bullied for being ""depressed"" when I was younger. It took a lot of strength for me to speak up because I felt that I couldn't bottle it up any longer. I felt weak for always being sensitive and an overthinker. I couldn't interact and be social with friends and classmates, as I was always scared of how they will perceive me and I wanted to be validated and loved just like the next person. This took a major hit to my academics and social life. I cried in the school canteen on my 16th birthday because my friends and family forgot all about it. 

Even then, I only was able to see a psychiatrist and go for therapy after many months and many referrals by the school counsellor and adults in my life. I still felt like crap everyday and made up excuses to chao keng and not go to school a lot because I dreaded it. I am more relaxed now in general waiting for my JAE results. 

Therapy and meds really changed my life for the better. I found out that I had ADHD, which was the main driving force behind my depression and anxiety, and gave me the answers to why I felt easily overwhelmed in tense situations and why I was so ""sensitive"", as my family always dubbed me. It was not my fault, it was just how my brain inherently reacted to such situations. My therapist also talked to my parents, which led to my dad and mom being more understanding and supportive of my situation for the most part (they still think therapy is for people with ""problems""), and for my dad to better manage his short fuse, and I didn't felt so on edge at home anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's not all sunshine and rainbows; anti-depressants are not an instant cure of depression, I only noticed an obvious uptick in my overall MH a year later. Moreover, I'm still struggling with my ADHD, as I've tried a wide range of very expensive meds and all have not only not helped but hurt me, setting back my progress. 

Although I'm more outgoing in a sense now, and more social, I still struggle with feeling like I'm truly accepted and loved by my peers and friends. I put up a persona as a funny, chill person, even when I felt like I was wading in deep waters. Up to my birthday yesterday, my intrusive thoughts snuck in and I thought ""what if they really pretended to want to come to my party but ghost me? what if it's awkward and they hate it?"" Fortunately, they all seemed to have a good time, and there were laughs all around. I even got presents, just like I had envied other people who were loved enough to get them. I'm proud of all the progress I have made (my therapist says I'm happier now too). 

I know I'm incredibly privileged to have such a good support system and parents that can afford the exorbitant costs of therapy and meds, and I emphasize with those struggling to get help because they don't have these. I hate that our society outwardly campaigns for better mental health, but are prejudiced against people who are depressed, autistic, anxious etc. and seek therapy, thinking that they must have severe issues. Most are also woefully uninformed about how depression affects people (see ""just don't be sad! try to think positive thoughts and be more positive lah!""). It's like being trapped in a soul-crushing, numbing black hole, voided of all feeling and fucks to give. It's feeling lonely even when you're not alone. It's the feeling of dread when you open your eyes to see the sunlight streaming through your blinds. The feeling of being a burden to your friends and family. Whydontijustdiesoeveryonewillbehappy..? Walks in the fresh air and the company of friends do relieve that feeling, but I feel like getting professional help significantly helped too. I guess this is my way of saying that the first step to getting help is so hard, but to quote Lao Tzu, ""*the path of a thousand miles begins with a single step*"". The process might be rockier than a Malaysian highway, but the ending is totally worth it.

singapore,"Some context, when talking to friends and online people alike, it seems that its very common for a lot of people to be earning 6-8k SGD a month, and it seems like anything lower than 4k is seen as abnormal and low? Is this really the case?

Currently, Im working in sales (more like account management, contracted sales, not out hunting commission based) and after working for 5 years (total) I'm making 4.2k as an assistant sales manager.

Now I've just finished my bachelors in business and I was wondering what would a viable career move would be, to move into that income range? What kind of jobs would be relevant for me with a business degree? Is 4.2k considered low for a 29 year old? 

Also, would an MBA be worth it to get? I have very little commitments in the way of family and kids etc, and have the financial means to get one.

Would love some career advice from laojiaos and peers alike.

I think there’s currently no scientific research on human brains relating to fungi mutations.

Application for the card has a $9 fee, BUT what Wise does during payment of the fee is use the $9 to top up your SGD balance, *then* deduct that balance to pay for the card fee. So, if you use a credit card to pay for it, it counts as a cash advance on the credit card, which you have to pay an exorbitant interest rate on. Ask me how I know.

The only way that you can know this beforehand is if you note that they use the word ""**Send** from your Visa or Mastercard."", which apparently indicates that this transaction counts as a money transfer, not a payment. Beware!

&amp;#x200B;

I made a police report and was disheartened at how little they could do. The officer sent me an email that they can't do anything based on the information I sent. What was shocking was that they referred to me a bunch of consumer-business dispute solutions like small claims when it was clearly a report on a scam.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this scammer has had multiple burner accounts that I included in the police report. I noticed that all these accounts were banned on Carousell already. It means he probably has scammed a few people.

&amp;#x200B;

If so, and since one could get away without any repercussions from scamming, why not I do it too? I could fleece a good amount and not get away since there really is no way to be held accountable for it.","There is no point in being moral and ""good"" in Singapore."

singapore,"Firstly let me just say that I love Singapore. I am someone who cares deeply about safety, so that is one major reason why I love Singapore. After that, the culture is similar to mine so thats that too. However, lets talk about some of the reasons why some people think SG is boring.

After doing a lot of research on this, I find that people calling SG boring is......mostly Singaporeans. Foreigners including myself are actually very respectful of SG and love it a lot. 

Yes, it is a fact that SG has a lot of man-made things. I am someone who LOVES nature too, but trust me, going to a nature place is not something you do that often. And I think, in SG, you can go to Malaysia which is a huge country, to be able to see nature, no?

Another commonly raised argument is that in SG all you can do is go to shopping malls, find something nice to eat, and thats it. Well...I am in Australia, and guess what I and so so many people like me do generally, week in week out? Go to a shopping mall, explore, walk around, find something nice to eat.....then go home. This is also what I used to do when I was still living in my birth country. 

My point is, isnt this what people around the world most commonly do? Yes, some people (including myself) want to see nature, but like I said above, it is not something you want to visit every single week or even month, its only something you want to visit every once in a while. After that, its back to the shopping malls again.....just like me in Australia. For example, in Australia you can go to a beach, etc here but in SG I believe there is the East Coast Park, no? The point im trying to make is, going to see nature is an awesome feeling but its not something you do very often, in fact its quite rare, once you have seen enough of it.

Ultimately, whether one finds SG boring or not all depends on the individual. But for me, the way I see it is, if SG was my home, it would be the perfect home because the most fundamental human need and also one that is very often taken for granted - safety - you have it. Of course, theres also cleanliness, stable/clean government, order, etc. 

Personally, again, if SG was my home, then what I would define as ""home"" is that, it does not have to be big, full of unexplored places, etc. A home can be small but if you feel safe and you feel you belong there, then that is more than enough. Now, if you want to see nature or other stuff, well, being in a very good location geographically, you can always fly to see other countries, right?","Just how ""boring"" is Singapore?

Book a ride via Gojek today, driver immediately messaged me to say he can’t do the ride cos he needed a lunch break. I thought fine, if you don’t want the job then cancel it so I can try to book another ride.

Driver did not respond to my text via app and also refused to pick up when I called him twice. Subsequently I got frustrated and texted to say I will cancel but said I will feedback to the service centre. The guy IMMEDIATELY replied, asked me to go ahead and proceeded to insult me (no vulgarities but the sort that implies my parents did not do a proper job in bringing me). Totally uncalled for.

For redditors who also work as PHV gig workers, can understand from your perspectives? Is the cost of cancellation on driver’s part so high that you need to start insulting another human being?

A compressor is one of the most important components of an air conditioning unit and it is responsible for compressing and circulating the refrigerant gas that cools the air.

Regular service of the compressor can help to maintain its performance and efficiency, which can prolong the lifespan of the unit. A well-maintained compressor will consume less energy, which can result in lower electricity bills. Additionally, regular [**aircon service** ](https://coolcare.com.sg/)can also help to identify potential problems with the compressor before they become serious, which can prevent costly repairs or replacements.

During a compressor service, a technician will check the unit for leaks, check the refrigerant levels, inspect the internal parts for wear or damage, and clean the unit. They will also lubricate the compressor's moving parts and check the electrical connections.

It is important to note that only a qualified technician should service the compressor, as it can be dangerous if not done properly. It is also important to follow the manufacturer's recommendations for service intervals and to use the right lubricants and refrigerants.[ #airconservicingsingapore](https://coolcare.com.sg/)

In summary, regular service of the aircon compressor is important for maintaining its performance and efficiency, which can prolong the lifespan of the unit and keep it running at optimal level.

**how do i know if my aircon compressor is repair ?** 

There are several signs that may indicate that your aircon compressor needs repair:

**No cooling:** If your aircon unit is not producing cool air or the cooling is not as effective as it used to be, this may be a sign that the compressor is not working properly.

**Loud noises:** If your aircon unit is making loud noises, such as banging, knocking, or humming sounds, this may be a sign that the compressor is damaged or that there is a problem with its internal parts.

**Leaks:** If you notice refrigerant leaks coming from the unit, this may be a sign that the compressor is damaged and needs to be repaired.

**Tripping circuit breaker:** If the aircon unit is tripping the circuit breaker, this may be a sign that there is a problem with the compressor's electrical systems.

**High energy bills:** If your energy bills have increased significantly and the unit seems to be running constantly, this may be a sign that the compressor is not working efficiently and needs to be repaired or replaced.

It is important to note that these are only general signs, and for a proper diagnosis, it is best to consult with a professional aircon technician. They can properly diagnose the issue with your unit and recommend the best course of action.

u_coolcare-singapore,"[**Aircon gas top up** ](https://coolcare.com.sg/aircon-gas-topup/)is the process of adding more refrigerant gas to an air conditioning unit. The refrigerant gas, also known as refrigerant, is responsible for absorbing heat from the inside of a building and expelling it outside. This is what makes aircon units effective at cooling the air inside.  [#airconservicing ](https://coolcare.com.sg/)

When an aircon unit leaks refrigerant gas, it loses its ability to cool the air effectively. This can cause the unit to work harder and consume more energy, which can lead to higher electricity bills. Additionally, a lack of refrigerant can also cause the unit to make more noise and can damage the compressor.

[**Aircon gas top up**](https://coolcare.com.sg/aircon-gas-topup/) is important to maintain the performance and efficiency of the unit. Additionally, it can also help prolong the lifespan of the unit by preventing damage to the compressor and other components.

It is important to note that only a qualified technician should perform [**aircon gas top up**](https://coolcare.com.sg/aircon-gas-topup/), as it can be dangerous if not done properly. The technician should have the right equipment and knowledge to handle the refrigerant gas safely and to ensure that the unit is charged with the proper amount of refrigerant.

Also, regular maintenance and cleaning of the unit, including filter replacement, and checking for leaks, is important to maintain the unit's performance and efficiency, and to prevent the need for frequent gas top ups.  [#airconservicecompany ](https://coolcare.com.sg/)

* R32 and R410A are both refrigerants commonly used in air conditioning systems. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages.
* R32 is considered to be a ""mildly flammable"" refrigerant, which means that it has a lower risk of fire compared to other refrigerants. It is also more energy efficient compared to R410A, which can lead to lower electricity bills. However, R32 has a higher global warming potential (GWP) compared to R410A.
* R410A, on the other hand, is considered to be a ""non-flammable"" refrigerant, which means that it has a lower risk of fire compared to other refrigerants. It also has a lower global warming potential (GWP) compared to R32. However, R410A is not as energy efficient as R32.

Both R32 and R410A have been widely used and accepted in the air conditioning industry. The choice between R32 and R410A will depend on the specific application and the priorities of the user. In some countries, R32 is being phased out due to its high GWP, and being replaced by R32 alternatives with lower GWP, like R290. It's always best to consult with a professional or check with the local regulations before making a decision.

singapore,"I am friendly neighbourhood adviser, I am a salaried adviser, I sometimes about insurance stuff on SG related insurance.

Because of my work, I get this question a lot from pregnant parents: what hospital plan do I buy for my infant?

One simple clause makes all the difference: **Waiting period for congenital conditions coverage**.

Here's what my research turned up:

**AIA**: No waiting period, covers from when policy starts.

**Pru/GE**: Within 1st 2 years covers about $10k-$20k limit.

**Singlife/AXA/Income**: 1 year waiting period (during waiting period no claims will be admitted)

**Raffles**: 2 years waiting period (during waiting period no claims will be admitted)

&amp;#x200B;

Which tier of coverage to buy? As parents, you can buy any tier you want, child's coverage usually lower cost compared to adults. But due to the risks, first 3 years premiums usually higher. 

But if you ask me, as most kids go KKH, and now that there is all that MOH approved treatment + cancer drug list, easiest thing to do is to take up govt tier hospital plan. Or the onus on ensuring the treatment is claimable kind of falls on the parents. (this is another topic all together, all parties (doctors, insurers, patients) play a part in this.)

\+++

""But all my insurance plan with one company, so it is easier.""

You do you. No company is the best company, because then what, only idiots buy from other companies? Each company have what they are good at. So be savvy or *fugat about it* (donnie brasco). 

\+++

Do let me know if any information is incorrect, and if other agents see this, do not shit on pricing and costs of other companies, the price difference in premiums are all within $500 of each other, but the amount claimable is so much different.",Hospital Plan for Infants: check out one simple clause

singapore,"The other day I received the news from my father that both my grand parents have passed on due to Covid 19. Hearing this my mom literally broke down since it’s her parents. While I felt nothing. No tears or sadness….just nothing.

In fact, I had to act shocked in front of my parents but deep down I don’t really care. In fact I am more concerned about my internship report and Uni modules. I am shocked by the fact I didn’t feel anything when I heard this news. Like these two old folks watch me grow up, pampered me when I was in primary school. They even babysit me daily when I was just a kindergarten kid. 

Same thing happened when a uncle who I was quite close to pass on. I was just “oh he died? Well it’s life.”

Is this even normal!? At this point I genuinely fear that I won’t feel anything when my own parents pass on.",Just realised I am a very heartless person.

Been having this annoying issue for a few years. Few times a week there would be loud noise of water flowing through the pipes of my hdb toilet from above.This lasts a few hours and annoyingly usually happens at night and persists until the next morning so it's affecting our sleeping hours. Sounds like the neighbor upstairs is just keeping their water on for the whole night for some reason.

I stay on 12th floor and my block highest is 16th. Can I confirm that it's my immediate neighbor above(13th floor)? Or it could be any floors up to 16th? Not familiar with how the plumbing system works for a hdb block. I would like to have a word with the neighbor as it's really loud.

One big potential problem I can see with part-time work is working past work hours and not getting paid for it because deadlines dont change and work still needs to get done. This becomes prominent when the social pressure of colleagues asking you for stuff comes in and thats when it becomes a big issue because you are essentially working full-time but not getting paid for it.

Other problems include having a really rough time finding a job (on top of jobs being already insanely hard to find) since most employers prefer full-time staff and of course, not having enough savings down the road.

They are scammers, I have even seen them sharing the money from the plastic pouch, and being so happy and giggling about the easy work. Tbh they look as though they are unemployed and delinquents.

Recently I just saw a guy holding that same clipboard being clingy to a lady and persuaded her to 'donate'. I tapped the guy and asked what kind of charity organisation they are helping and told the lady that it is a scam. Instead of explaining to me, the guy just ran away, so shady.

Ok I dont know what charity name is printed on the papers, but if in any case I am wrong, pls lmk and I will take this post down. I just cant stand ppl using the name of 'charity' to con good-willed people of their hard-earned money. I was almost scammed myself cos the guy was pressuring me, but luckily I didnt donate.

singapore,"This is follow up to my [ongoing minor nightmare](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zn6h20/can_i_withhold_a_reno_contractors_final_payment/) with regards to a resale flat's reno. I'm going to spare you guys alot of details because otherwise this post would literally fill your screen but basically the latest - and most serious - defect that we discovered as a nasty surprise is electrical.

As briefly as possible: when we first plugged in our washing machine at its outlet it wouldn't power on. In pc-building elimination style I plugged in a charger at that double outlet to test if got power. Breakers also checked. So we concluded the WM is spoilt. Today I did a bit of handwash laundry and plugged in a floorstand-style exhaust fan to help with airdry. After about 10s the whole house tripped. And its not just the MCB, the main breaker outside my door also tripped. I reset all of it, went back to test that outlet - it's dead.

As you may now suspect - *of course* the washing machine is not dead. The outlet in a newly-reno unit is dead. The (licensed) subcon who did the wiring is also the same guy who's responsible for a majority of items on the defects list, so suffice to say his workmanship is very suspect.

I called up HDB to explain the sitch and the guy didn't really offer much except that he would ""arrange for a callback within 3-5 WD"", which isn't much help since it's very near CNY and I'm due to meet the maincon for final handover tomorrow.

Q:
Who else can I contact to get a professional assessment or testing of the wiring and load capacity in my unit? We have grounds to believe that the workmanship in our unit is compromised. The worst thing that could happen is a fire down the line and this maincon just blame it on some bullshit like 'oh you plug in too many computers' etc.",Resale reno electrical problems - how to engage someone to assess/inspect?

Sometime in 2015 I first came into r/sg to seek general advice on leaving a toxic ops management role and transiting towards self employment. The community was small but tight knit and helpful. While studying for my real estate agent license, I started to drive for uber and had a great time doing an AMA in the early heydays of phv. 

It's around 7-8 years since I last shared, right now I'm a full time phv driver. It have been a remarkable adventure. During these years, my baby grew into a sweaty and smelly mid primary school kid, I've gotten a divorce, dated and broken up a couple of times there-after, worked as a real estate salesperson, private investigator, did a divemaster internship while working for a dive shop, worked in commercial diving (ship husbandry and construction), temped as as assistant dolphin trainer, opened and closed a small online retail business, delivered grab food and other random temp jobs. 

Throughout these years, I have always been driving phv either on a full or part time basis, both out of necessity (income) and also it is my fav job. 

I'm not a very smart or educated person but I often receive request from slightly younger redditors to share my not-so conventional journey so here I am again after some time. I'll try my best to put aside my pride / ego in this ""sharing session"" and hope we have a great kopi chat.",Phv driver 8th year update

singapore,"TLDR: If you need help from HDB and called up HDB branch service line, they will probably give you contact numbers (yes, sometimes more than one number) of the officer supposedly in charge. But watch out - these numbers never go through! Instead, you should ask the service line for the officer's office location and go down there!

&amp;#x200B;

I recently sold my HDB flat to buy a new one, and had to deal with HDB several times due to different hiccups. The lesson I learned is that, the contact number of HDB officers that I got from HDB branch service line are useless. The officers won't answer those calls, some go directly to voice mail, some just no pick-up, ever. There was one time, I kept calling one officer for like weeks, until her voice mailbox is FULL - but still no answer or call-back! This happened again today, the officer’s number I got from HDB branch service line directly goes to voice mail. Knowing this is a dead-end, I decided to go down to the branch office that I believe the officer should be based in. I went down to the office, I asked the reception lady to help me speak to the officer, and guess what? The lady pulled out her mobile, dialled a number and got the elusive officer on speaker immediately! The reception lady later told me that she called the officer's personal number, not any of her work number - that's how we got to get her. I was also told the officer’s personal number will never be given to customers, so I will never get to speak to her on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lesson of my story: if you need to find an HDB officer, don't waste your time calling their numbers, just directly head down to their office!",TIL: HDB officers never answer phone calls to their office number

Idk if they removed it because it was one of their least popular burgers beforehand, but still, they should rlly consider my needs before making such drastic measures.

singapore,"Hey all,  as mentioned in the title, I'm feeling unsure if to pursue a Part-Time Diploma or a Full Time one. For context, please allow me to share some information about myself.

* Male, turning 25 this year
* Been working in a Public Hospital for 1.5 years as a Therapy Assistant
* Highest Qualification: Higher Nitec in Events Management (2017)
* Goal Career Sector: Govt Public Security Agencies
* Educational Goal: Public Security Degree (SUSS or Macquarie)
* PES B4 (trying to Up-PES)
* Ex-SPF Regular (signed on before NS, resigned and broke bond due to personal reasons)

I have intentions to join ICA and I recently had my application to their Work-Study Diploma in Security Operations with ITE rejected.

Looking at alternative plans, I find myself caught in a dilemma between enrolling in Temasek Poly's  [Part-Time Diploma in Policing &amp; Security Management (DPSM)](https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools-and-courses/adult-learners/all-courses/part-time-diploma-post-diploma-courses/diploma-in-policing-and-security-management.html#course-schedule) or [Republic Poly's Diploma in Health Management and Promotion (DHMP)](https://www.rp.edu.sg/Shl/full-time-diplomas/Details/diploma-in-health-management-and-promotion).

**Diploma in Policing &amp; Security Management (DPSM)**

DPSM's content is very much in line with what I want to do as a future career. My plan with this path is to re-apply to ICA after graduation and ideally have a sponsored degree with them. However, I fear that if my application is unsuccessful yet again, I do not have many good job opportunities.

With my current PES, I can't sign on to the other MHA uniformed services and I'm not keen to work for Private Security companies.  Unless my attempt to Up-PES is successful, I think I'd be in a tight spot in terms of looking to work in the Public Security Sector. Plus, I am unsure if I can juggle work and studies for 2.5 years.

**Diploma in Health Management and Promotion (DHMP)**

DHMP is something I am applying for under DAE by virtue of my work experience in a hospital. I have 2 similar paths with this course.

1. *Apply for the Home Team Diploma Sponsorship, which covers my school fees and offers me an employment with ICA or another HT department.*
2. *Attain the diploma and apply for ICA via their usual Direct Entry Sergeant route.*

My concerns for this route are that I'd be studying something I have less interest for albeit having considerable experience in. I fear I won't be able to sustain motivation to get a good GPA to attain the sponsorship. I also don't really want to study something for the sake of it.

**Key Issue: Guarantors**

In both situations, another problem is that should I been offered employment as an officer, I'd have to nominate 2 guarantors for my bond. In most cases, people can just ask my parents but requirements are they need to be 21-60 years old and gainfully employed.

My dad is 71 and my mom is unemployed. I don't want ask my relatives because they are not close to me and my closest aunt was very particular about it (complaining a lot about having to disclose her salary) when i got her to sign as my guarantor for my SPF Bond. I'm sure my parents, mom especially would not be very happy with my decision of choosing to go back to the uniformed services, mostly over the bond part and my mom also keeps pestering me to take a job that doesn't involve firearms.

In closing, I would like to hear what everyone thinks and if there's any advice that you'll like to share in helping me make an informed decision I would very much appreciate it!  Please also feel free to ask me further questions if you need to clarify things.",Unsure if to pursue Part-Time Diploma or Full Time Diploma

His guess is that she might’ve have moved to China as her work involved traveling to China often and non existent on fb/LinkedIn could be because those are banned in China.

u_coolcare-singapore,"A[ aircon chemical wash](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/), also known as a chemical cleaning, is a process in which chemicals are used to clean the internal components of an air conditioner. Chemical washes are often performed as part of regular maintenance to remove dirt, dust, and other contaminants from the air conditioner.

There are potential benefits to using a chemical wash for an air conditioner, including:

1. **Improved efficiency:** A [aircon chemical wash](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/) can help to remove dirt and debris from the air conditioner, improving its efficiency and performance.
2. **Improved air quality:** A[ aircon chemical wash](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/) can help to remove pollutants and allergens from the air conditioner, improving the indoor air quality.
3. **Extended lifespan:** A [aircon chemical wash](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/) can help to extend the lifespan of the air conditioner by removing contaminants that can cause damage to the unit.

However, it is important to have a chemical wash performed by a trained and licensed professional to ensure that it is done safely and effectively. Using the wrong chemicals or performing the wash incorrectly can cause damage to the air conditioner.

**How do i know if my aircon need chemical wash?**

There are several signs that may indicate that your air conditioner needs a chemical wash:

1. **Reduced cooling efficiency:** If the air conditioner is not cooling as efficiently as it used to, it may be due to a build-up of dirt and debris inside the unit. A chemical wash can help to remove these contaminants and improve the efficiency of the air conditioner.
2. **Strange noises:** If the air conditioner is making strange noises, it may be due to a build-up of dirt and debris inside the unit. A chemical wash can help to remove these contaminants and reduce the noises.
3. **Poor indoor air quality:** If you have noticed an increase in allergies or respiratory issues, it may be due to poor indoor air quality. A chemical wash can help to remove pollutants and allergens from the air conditioner, improving the indoor air quality.
4. **Increased energy costs:** If your energy bills have increased unexpectedly, it may be due to an inefficient air conditioner. A chemical wash can help to improve the efficiency of the air conditioner and reduce energy costs.

u_coolcare-singapore,"There are several potential reasons why an air conditioner may leak water, including:

1. **Clogged drain line:** The drain line is responsible for carrying excess water away from the air conditioner. If the drain line is clogged, water may leak from the unit. To fix this, the drain line should be cleaned or unclogged.
2. **Frozen evaporator coils:** The evaporator coils are responsible for absorbing heat from the air. If the evaporator coils become frozen, water may leak from the unit. To fix this, the air conditioner should be turned off and allowed to thaw. [#airconwaterleaking](https://coolcare.com.sg/why-is-the-air-conditioner-leaking-water-or-dripping-how-to-fix-it/)
3. **Incorrect installation:** If the air conditioner was improperly installed, it may leak water. To fix this, the unit should be inspected by a trained professional and any necessary repairs should be made.

It is important to have an air conditioner leak addressed as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the unit and the surrounding area. If you are unable to fix the leak yourself, it is recommended to call a trained and licensed professional for assistance.

Hey everyone, a little about me, I'm a 30+ woman still living with my long time divorced mom, we were doing okay with just us, had a HDB home at a good location in the west. As of a week ago, no longer staying at said place owned by my mom. Please bear with me as this will be a long story.

And now, a little about my mom... She has a history of getting involved in scams, the first few I knew about it because she involved me and I managed to intercept it before it got too bad and we got the money back. The rest were mostly love scams but it never got to the point where she involved actual money in it.

Last year, if I recalled at one point she ask me if I was happy staying where I was, which was a weird question but I said something along the line of I wouldn't mind if we moved to a different place. In hindsight, probably a stupid thing to say, but it was because of my mom's hoarding issue that I thought moving out would be a good idea, and that was the only reason I said that, if I could move away from her hoard of items to a different place and start new, I would be happy (was what I thought at the time)

Few months later she already decided to put the house to sale, she sold the house within the year. I don't think she ever involved me in her decision because I didn't even know she sold the house until much later.

At first I thought she had a plan, maybe sell the house and downsize to a smaller place as I had no issue with that. But as I found out much much later and way too late, she was involved in something much sinister. She was telling me not to worry about the money and getting a new place and that she will have the money for it, so I assumed she had some plan going in with this entire endeavor. When I asked her if she was involved with someone asking her for money, or some weird crypto money scheme or anything involving money, she said 100% no and told me not to worry about money cause we will be okay.

I was already very worried at this point but it was far too late to ask her to stop since she already sold the house. During the course of the moving process there was so much pain and family drama from all sides all warning her not to go through with it, but she didn't listen. Even if she did, it was far too late, the house was sold already.

After selling the house I found out she was also borrowing money from family members and her friends, I thought it was for the purpose of looking for a temporary apartment until we had an actual place of stay. That was supposed to be the plan see, sell the house, stay at a cheap budget hotel until Jan 5 where she will get her money and pay everyone back and then get an apartment. Of course, obviously that didn't happen, at this point I already knew. I knew it but it was too late to do anything and back away.

So just yesterday, I finally found out about the secret ""guy"" she was talking to for 2 years and was romantically involved with ""borrowed"" money from her with almost all the savings she got from selling the house and the loans from family members. She basically gave away almost all her money to the scammer, and she didn't care to ask me about it before transferring all the money. I was beyond mad when I heard about it, like why didn't she tell me she was transferring large amounts of money to someone I didn't even know existed. Why did I have to hear about it after the police report.

So now, not only do we not have a house anymore, but we don't even have the money for a house anymore.

The police has been involved and notified of her case, I don't know if we are able to get the money back as it had happen on a course of a few months... I'm actually losing hope and I know the money is gone and there's very little chance of getting the money back....

I don't have that much money myself, much less a house, so I can't support us either financially at the moment. I had to postpone a part time job due to how hectic the moving situation was, and I also had to spend whatever I had left for item storage and putting my pet into boarding. I'm currently looking into a full-time job and trying to get back to my part-time at the same time.

Sorry if everything seems incoherent to everyone here, I tried my best to pace out the events as it happened.

I partly blame myself already for saying that one offhand comment about how nice it would be to have a new place, and believing she had put in our best interests. But after this, I can no longer believe anything she says anymore. I'm actually planning to take away her smartphones and downgrade her phone so she can no longer involved herself with people like this for her safety and everyone around her.

I also added some proof of the police report in case anyone thinks this is a crock of shite. Believe me, I would love for things to go back to normal, I'm honestly still in shock we don't have a home now, sometimes I feel like things don't seem real. https://imgur.com/a/PI9KAyY

I have never ask of this to anyone online much less strangers, but if anyone could provide some financial assistance on our dire situation I would appreciate it. Even just abit helps, just to help get us back on our feet until our situation stabilizes. I'm looking into family centers for aid and shelters meanwhile, but that takes awhile for them to process.

 The real issue that people complain about is that 1% increase somehow causes the products paid by the end consumer to increase by 5%- 20%. Your chicken rice which cost $4.50 last year can cost $5 now. That's more than a 10% increase rather than just 1%. 

I'm not saying that all prices should increase by just 1% cause there are alot more factors in play such as inflation. But I feel the government could do a more active role in policing establishments that use the increase to hike up their prices as well as reassuring the people that any abuse of the increase will not be tolerated.",True sentiment about GST increase

Let me preface this, of course there are exceptions, there are plenty of amazing homes. However, I am singling out the bulk of homes and generalising here.

**First-time homeowners**

Since many Singaporeans have never lived on their own, much less had their own space to curate, there is a general inexperience in designing a space. There is also this overcompensation or overexcitement to do everything and try everything. This inexperience also enables the over-reliance on IDs (interior designers), while there are of course competent ones, many lack formal training or design background and for a lack of a better term “good taste and an eye for design”. They are often over-glorified project managers and often just push the same packages. Foreign homeowners would have lived in many own spaces over the years and have had more time to develop their design style and know how they want to curate the space.

**The obsession with built-in everything**

I’m not sure where this stems from (if you have any theories please suggest) but I’m sure the above-mentioned IDs have a heavy hand in this, but I noticed Singaporeans love getting things built in. However, the suggested built-ins don’t take into consideration the scale of the space and often are very basic general forms as the common contractor doesn’t really do details or fine finishing. Compared to buying furniture from even a basic shop like Ikea where the designer really takes into consideration the proportion of the finished form. the local ID isn’t really in tune with the nuances, take for example a house tour I watched where the owner complained that the countertops we too Low for her and that she gets backaches from washing plates. Also, too much built-in furniture means that over time the house looks dated and is unable to evolve. A lot of this built-in carpentry that I’ve seen also tends to be super clunky and boxy.

**Lack of understanding of user behaviour**

As mentioned above, having never lived out on their own, many new homeowners don’t really have time to fully understand their new routines outside of the family home. They don’t design a home around their needs and instead are designing a home around what they think they need. There tends to be either too much storage space or not enough. They might over or underestimate the kitchen appliances they need.

**Allergic to colour**

I think in general Singaporeans are allergic to colour. Many homes are decked out in neutrals and greys. I think many see this as a shortcut to taste, but rather to me this highlights the lack of it. Singaporeans also shy away from bolder colours like maroon, oranges, emerald greens and amethyst. This isn’t just in the home, but I’ve noticed this recurrence in general architecture in Singapore and even down to local fashions. I think this also stems from the underlying Singapore culture of not wanting to stand out too much and overall conformity. This might be my own personal taste but accent colours even among a sea of beige can really liven things up and add a new level of sophistication.

**Not understanding light**

A lot of home neglect good lighting. Yes, overhead lights in the brightest white are practical but they do little to set the mood. Accent lights are often an afterthought. A lot of homeowners just rely on large ceiling lights and don’t incorporate lamps. The colour temperature of lights also tends to be neglected.

**Copy and pasting**

many homeowners on the ID suggestions also just do what is conventional and routine. There is often rarely any originality. Many times aesthetics which are not suited to the space are chosen and then a poor replication is attempted. It’s like seeing the original and then making a knockoff. There is no sin in drawing inspiration from other homes, obviously, however, a lot of contractors don’t do a good job of turning a concept into reality and translating it to the space at hand. Good design is context-based, what may look good in a larger home may be a poor fit for a smaller home, and adaptations and alterations must be carried out for it to make sense.

**Doing everything all at once**

Since Singaporeans don’t move out at an earlier age, they haven’t accumulated home furnishings over time, slowly refining their taste. Even things like decor items are normally purchased all at the same time, in a matching aesthetic. This may complete the home faster but it lacks real character. There usually aren’t charming stories behind each item, and things are not added in slowly to match the space. This adds to the odd kind of superficial feeling I have noticed in many Singaporean homes, which I see less of in foreign homes. The spaces don’t feel lived in.

**Inauthenticity**

The copy and pasting and buying a full set of items in a matching aesthetic just somehow creates this impression of authenticity which is interesting, what I think I take the biggest issue with in most Singapore homes. The houses rarely reflect any character or the personality of their owners, there are no quirks, just a sort of blandness and sameness. It almost feels like a brand-new movie set rather than a home. A lot of homes consequently lack a warmness to them, and I’m not even talking about style here. Even a minimalist or industrial space can be warm and inviting. I think a lot of first-time owners feel pressure to create an instagrammble aesthetically pleasing home, and thus stick to safe and predictable choices on a monochromatic theme rather than thinking outside the box, or creating their own flair and style.

**Art is not a consideration**

Art also tends to be forgotten. There is usually a lack of any original wall art, or art in general, think of sculptures, pottery or wall hangings. And no, original artwork does not have to be expensive, there is plenty of DIY art you can make in an hour or just browse etsy or local artists. Things like this tend to elevate a home with blank walls. Even well-chosen printed-out stock photos from something like unsplash can be stunning, and printing only costs less than $20.

**Constraints**

We should also address the HDB is a unique design constraint in Singapore. However, it should not be an excuse. Any space can incorporate good design.

**Lack of exposure to good design**

I think in general the broad population of Singapore has had limited exposure to good design. It isn’t woven into the fabric of our culture like it is for some others. Understandable since we were a developing country not so long ago, and lofty ideals like design were eschewed for pragmatism and essentials. Hopefully, in time the younger generations will develop a stronger appreciation for design and this will be reflected in future dwellings.","Why Singapore homes are so badly designed, in my opinion"

singapore,[removed],Need Help for my business
singapore,"Hi,

just returned from Japan, thought I should share some advice for those intending to head there:

1) Regional railways were quite affected by the weekend snow storm, many cancelled, buses still operate, but expect unexpected expenses as a result. Snow storm looks cool on videos, was terrifying when you are in it... so freezing cold I couldnt even hold my phone except when I absolutely need it for directions. I last went Japan in 2019 when I had to hunt for a tiny patch of snow. This time round, even Nara had snow.

2) Figure out how to alight esp when taking smaller regional trains. I missed my station because I thought I could open the door with the buttons.... nope. You need to go to car 1 where the conductor is.

3) It's fully dark at 5pm. I had problems walking 10m in the cold slippery snow and the darkness, let alone the 2km because I missed my station.

4) Dont laugh, I didnt know how to hail a cab. Didnt have it set up. Singapore brain assumed it ought to be easy to get a cab at a train station or I could walk the planned 500m. The damn station was just a cabin with no humans in sight and fellow travellers who alighted at the same stop had cars waiting and gone in a jiffy. Fortunately I had internet access and managed to find a number to dial for a cab. 

5) Ski schools are super overbooked already. Plan early if you can... Singapore brain assumed I could just walk in and find a coach.

6) Prepare for unexpected car sickness, dont sure why, didnt have this problem before on previous train trips. Stick to Shinkansen if you have JR pass. However, Google maps only give directions for Nozomi, which you cant take with JR pass, so I had to learn to read timings off the board. You want Hikari when travelling between Tokyo and Osaka and Asama between Tokyo and Nagano.

7) I had a bad experience with Scoot before but this time, Scoot was everything I needed, barely missed anything. You can fill your water bottle at the waiting area at Singapore side after customs. You can buy food and drinks at Kansai side after customs. Customs and checkin queue can take some time at Kansai side.

8) Universal Studios Japan look crowded but the queues are reasonable. Took the Mario Kart within an hour. Thought it is terribly overrated, esp for an adult. Super Nintendo land is super crowded, dont plan to eat your lunch there as the restaurant queue is longer than the ride, but since you need a timed ticket to get in to Super Nintendo land, you cant go out for a quick bite and return. The wristband every influencer say is a must buy is not a must buy. Damn lies. Not much else changed, no evening parade.

9) I think I am done with AirBnB. You cant know the location for sure in advance and it is not funny staying next to a fire station or above a busy restaurant that closes late and none of the reviews mention this.",Sharing travel advice for Japan

u_coolcare-singapore,"There could be several reasons why your air conditioning unit is not cooling properly. Here are a few potential causes and some steps you can take to try to resolve the issue:

1. **The air filter is dirty:** If the air filter is clogged with dirt, dust, and debris, it can restrict airflow and cause the air conditioner to work harder to cool the room. Try replacing the air filter and see if that improves the cooling performance. [#airconnotcooling](https://coolcare.com.sg/aircon-not-cooling-how-to-fix-it/)

1. **The refrigerant is low:** The refrigerant is the substance that absorbs heat from the air inside your home and releases it outside. If the refrigerant is low, it can cause the air conditioner to struggle to cool the room. This is a problem that will require a professional to fix, as handling refrigerant can be dangerous.
2. **The outdoor unit is blocked:** The outdoor unit of an air conditioner needs proper airflow in order to function correctly. If the unit is blocked by leaves, debris, or other objects, it could be causing the air conditioner to struggle to cool your home.
3. **The thermostat is not set correctly:** Make sure that the thermostat is set to a temperature lower than the current room temperature. If the thermostat is set too high, the air conditioner will not turn on or will not run long enough to cool the room. [#airconnotcold](https://coolcare.com.sg/aircon-not-cooling-how-to-fix-it/)
4. **The air conditioner is not the right size for the room:** If the air conditioner is too small for the room, it will struggle to cool the space. On the other hand, if the unit is too large, it will cool the room too quickly and then shut off, leaving the room feeling humid.
5. **The air conditioner is old or in need of repair:** If your air conditioner is more than 10 years old or has not been properly maintained, it may be time to consider replacing it. Alternatively, you may need to have a professional repair any issues with the unit.

u_coolcare-singapore,"In Singapore, air conditioning is a necessity due to the hot and humid climate. Installing an air conditioner, such as a Daikin air conditioner, can help to cool and dehumidify the air in a home or office, making it more comfortable to live or work in. Additionally, air conditioners can help to filter out pollutants and improve indoor air quality. [#Daikinairconinstallation ](https://coolcare.com.sg/daikin-aircon-installation-service/)

There are various types of air conditioners available on the market, including window units, split systems, and central air systems. Daikin is a well-known brand that offers a range of air conditioners for residential and commercial use, including both inverter and non-inverter models. Inverter air conditioners are more energy efficient and can help to save on energy costs, making them a popular choice in Singapore.

My friends who signed up using Moneysmart got it within a reasonable timeframe but for a long time Singsaver had not sent any form of notification email. When I inquired them about it, their response was ""we already sent the notification email"" but I didn't receive anything of the sort.

However, when I complained that I didn't receive any such email, they just said that since the collection period is over it would be forfeited without exception, which I think is ridiculous.

I checked with other friends  who also used Singsaver in the past and they told me they encountered something similar - Singsaver conveniently ""forgets"" to send you the email and only when you write in do they notify you that it's ready for collection.

This is really scummy business practice - on top of them being much slower than Moneysmart they resort to shady tactics like failing to notify and hoping people will forget about it.

M1 does not publish this info on their website (that i could find through a Google search), and i was referring to a blog post someone posted, but that was outdated from 1-2 years back, when the existing app still worked. 

I stumbled upon an SMS in her phone from 1-2 days ago, informing customers that there’s a new My M1+ app. Gave that a shot, and voila, it worked immediately. Only

Are they afraid of the possible hyperinflation that would come from a sudden jump in GST? Are they afraid that Business will raise prices? (even though they reconvene the GST committee...) Are they afraid of the possible economic impact that will come from the GST Hike?",GST Hike Discussion

Let me get the ball rolling: 
1. Ryokuoushoku Shakai (緑黄色社会) - This 4-piece Japanese band gives me that much-needed caffeine boost every morning. Equal parts groovy and chock-full positive energy. [Recommendations: Mela!, Michi wo Yuke (ミチヲユケ), and キャラクター] 
 
2. 유라 (youra) - This Korean soloist is 100% built from the ground up with pure vibes. [Recommendations: Best regards, Rawww, and The Fin (w/ Mandong)] 
 
3. Su Lee - This Korean soloist is that derpy + talented friend that will take every opportunity to remind you not to take yourself too seriously. [Recommendations: I’ll Just Dance, Sleepy Hollow, Thank You Song]
 
[BONUS] 
麻婆豆腐 (mabodofu) - This is a faceless vocaloid producer (I know, not everyone’s cup of tea), does amazing covers of popular anime songs, along with similarly amazing original songs. [Recommendations: Telecaster B-Boy (テレキャスタービーボーイ), グッバイ宣言, and even (w/ hikaru)]","I posted here a year ago about concerts. Now, let’s talk about something a bit more within our control."

singapore,"Hi guys. As per the title, i’m a 17M Singaporean, and now am very invested in taking proper care of my skin and hair. Thankfully, i’m pretty okay ? but one can never be too careful.


For skincare, I’m just planning to start with a basic moisturiser and cleanser. Honestly, I know essentially nothing about this, so if anyone could recommend any brand that is not super harsh on the skin, that’d be great and I’d really appreciate it. If anyone has experience regularly using sunscreen and a retinoid product, I hope you don’t mind sharing as I’m curious on whether I should use them or not.

For my hair, I’m hoping to get a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. I’ve tried looking online and all I could find was Alpecin Caffeine and even then some of their products do have sulfates😭if anyone can recommend me, TIA so so much.

Thank you so much to any replies, and have a restful year end holiday !!",Please recommend skin and haircare for a blur sotong 17M

u_coolcare-singapore,"Your air conditioner works hard to keep you cool and comfortable all summer long. One of the best ways to care for your AC is to schedule a chemical wash with a reputable [aircon servicing](https://coolcare.com.sg/) company.

An [aircon chemical wash ](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/)thoroughly cleans all the parts of your air conditioner, removing any dirt, grime, or other build-ups that can impede its performance. This ensures that your AC will operate at peak efficiency, saving you money on your energy bills. In addition, a clean AC unit is less likely to experience breakdowns or other problems.

There are many other benefits of scheduling a regular chemical wash for your air conditioner. Here are just a few:

**1. Improved Air Quality**

A [aircon chemical wash](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/) removes all the dirt and grime from your AC unit, resulting in cleaner, healthier air for your home. This is especially beneficial for people with allergies or respiratory problems.

**2. Extended AC lifespan**

When you take good care of your air conditioner, it will last longer. This means you won’t have to replace it as often, saving you money in the long run.

**3. Lower energy bills**

A well-maintained AC unit uses less energy to operate, which can save you money on your monthly energy bills.

**4. Fewer repairs**

By keeping your AC unit clean and in good working order, you can avoid the need for costly repairs down the road.

**5. Improved cooling**

A [aircon chemical wash ](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/)can actually improve the cooling power of your AC unit

I have 2 close friends, a guy and a girl. Both aren't physically attractive.

Let's just call the guy, ""A"" and the girl, ""B"".

A is a friendly guy who likes to make small talk, ask follow-up questions about other people's work and personal life after the other party shared it first. He does it for both guys and girls, but he always gets frosty receptions from girls because they think he is romantically interested in them and wants to hit on them, when in reality, he is more than happy being single. End up, the girls thinking he is romantically interested all try to distance themselves/

The scenario will be such: A meets someone new, the someone shares about his/her work and life. Subsequently when A meets this someone again, he will follow up on the someone's work and life.

B is also like A, a bubbly girl who brings joy to people around her. She is also friendly to both guys and girls, like A, she will show interest in someone's work and personal life if it was shared by the other party. But she gets gossip for being ""desperate to marry"" because many think her friendliness is due to that.

We all read self-help books that showing interest in people's life is a sign of a good conversationalist. But it does not seem to apply here, which my hypothesis is that looks play a huge part when people determine your intention. If you are attractive, then you make a good conversationalist. If you aren't, you are being overbearing.

Alternatively, Singaporeans are just too reserved.",Your intention is determined by your looks

All sales should be based on the original sale value of the 99-year lease. So, if a flat has 90 years remaining, the resale price of the flat should be 90% of its original price, adjusted for inflation.

This means that profiteering from HDB flats will be less of a problem. We won't have situations like the recent case of a HDB flat owner leaving the flat vacant for 8 years, because there is no more incentive to do so.

Isn't this in line with HDB's objective of providing affordable housing for Singaporeans?",Should all HDB flat transactions be with HDB?

singapore,"20+M who regularly runs at midnight on a standard loop around a cluster of blocks. Recently, one of the roads was closed for construction works, and a stretch of the path has become dark and unlit (despite being next to the void deck). 

I told my girlfriend that recently someone began running the same route in the opposite direction, and she shines her flashlight every time she runs past this dark stretch. I said maybe she was looking out for snails on the ground, because what else?

Instead, I was told that maybe it's not the snails she's worried about, but it could be ME she's worried about, because the only time I see her running the dark stretch, I'M running past her. 

Now, during my runs I'm thinking ridiculous, intrusive thoughts like: ""oh, this lady should see me at the traffic light LEAVING so she knows I've finished my run, IF NOT she will run past and be scared and think I'm fucking hiding in the bushes or something."" 

It's literally cover-my-phone-camera-at-the-gym-whenever-a-girl-walks-past level of insecurity (which I realise I already do). 

It took me 3 days to become convinced that the only way I can be at peace with myself is to change route or drag my girlfriend to start running the route with me, so regardless of whether this lady acknowledges my existence—or let alone is scared of me (both of which I've apparently assumed as fact)—she will be assured that I am indeed human, and not a stalker/mugger/murderer.

I know I've kind of answered my question on whether if I'm overthinking or not, but I still want to know if there is any validity to these strange thoughts. To be clear, I'm only like 2% serious about this post, I'll probably go back to thinking about neighbourhood snail-stewardship soon enough, but some part of me feels it taps on something real..",Late-night running: Justified fear or overthinking?

singapore,"Hi guys, just wanted to ask what are my courses of action regarding this matter:

My friend bought a new prebuilt aftershock pc back in February this year. Up till today, that PC has been turned on and used for a max of 20 times as she is not a PC user and she had bought it to play Hogwart's Legacy.  It has been used to game about 5 out of the 20 times it's been turned on. And it's only the games Stray and It Takes Two. Other than that it has always  been off and not touched.

Here is where the issue is. It has been failing turn on for way more than the 20 times she's used it. We've called aftershock and sent it in for repair because it's still under the 3 years warranty and every single time we get it back, it works for maybe the first and MAYBE the second time she turns it on after getting it back. After that it just does not turn on at all. We've turned the switch on the PC and the main switch on and off multiple times. We've disconnected and reconnected all the wires from the PC and the monitor just as many times. Nothing works.

Recently she sent her PC for repair again two weeks ago. It came back last Thursday and she used it for light YouTube videos on Saturday night. Turned it off and thought nothing of it until last night when she wanted to turn it on to use it and guess what? It didn't turn on at all.

Did all the turning on and off of the switches again and reconnected all the wires and switched main plug sockets but nothing works. It simply just does not turn on at all.

Is there any recourse for this situation because she is at her wits end and it's wasting both our time and energy trying to figure this out. At this point I'm sure she has spent way more time trying to troubleshoot the issue rather than using it properly.",Help about aftershock prebuilt PC

It happened to me today, with an almost exact modus operandi. Thought I share some details on it.

Pic 1:
1) The scammer will ask for delivery. And mention the use of the platform’s delivery service.
2) The scammer will want your phone number, claiming it is required to arrange the delivery.

*1st red flag*: No one should ask for your phone number.
*2nd red flag*: There is no such thing as phone number requirement (from the seller) for delivery. 

Pics 2 &amp; 3:
3) The scammer may attenpt to assuage your suspicions by sending a seemingly legit looking info chart. The info chart looks official from Carousell but upon closer inspection is FAKE.

*3rd red flag*: None of the info in the chart makes sense. It claims that phone number is required. It even says “Everything is absolutely safe”, again trying to assuage suspicions, but is too hard-nosed for its own sake. 
*4th red flag:* It specifies WhatsApp and a link. No other app should be involved in your Carousell business. The link will be highly dangerously too. 
*5th red flag*: It says “Make sure your card is not blocked”. Why would you need your card details to RECEIVE payments from a sale? This is obviously for the scammer to gain your card details to do fraudulent transactions.",PSA: Beware of Carousell scam tactic

singapore,"Here's a question about the HDB market.

In the short term, the resale price of a new-ish HDB flat tends to appreciate. This is why HDB lease-owners today treat their flats like investment assets.

But in the long term, as the lease of a flat goes to zero, the market price of that flat will naturally also decline to zero.

So my question is, at which year in the lease (60? 50?) does it stop being an appreciating asset? When does a HDB flat start to depreciate?",At what point in the lifespan of a HDB lease will it stop being an appreciating asset?

My room hasn’t always been mouldy. It’s started some time in Feb 2022.

The adjacent room beside was rented out and the aircon is constantly turned on, which resulted in my wall being fairly cold relative to the rest.

I have tried to match the temperature of my room and the adjacent one. I have tried using those disposable and plugged in dehumidifier. I have tried keeping my room well ventilated. I have tried to use diluted bleach water to wipe down my furnitures and belongings. I moved my belongings away from the colder wall.

None of the above works. 

The last straw for me is when i saw my new leather bag mouldy today. It is one of the few things I decided to buy and treat myself to and it has sentimental value. 

This mouldy situation is really driving me crazy. Is there a service provider i can engage or some advise that I can use to help with the situation?

expat here.
I recent got to salary analysis stage on last Friday with one big MNC company.

Expected - 7500 SGD/month

I got managing experience back at my home countries at big MNCs and graduated from a reputable UK university.
I grabbed my first job at low pay of 4000 given the 30-day visa.
Now this position is managing position so I asked for a jump.
They asked for payslip with bonus and by today, it is 2-days already and no feedback yet.

I forgot to input ""Negotiable"" in expected salary.

1) should I follow up and add ""negotiable"" term or
2) should i just wait?
3) or make a phone call to clarify with HR

Here's the description:

- Expensive nasi padang stall at wisma food court on the upper floors, located near the escalator 
- an Indonesian/specifically Balinese nasi padang if I'm not wrong
- you help yourself to the sambal when done paying, and the sambal is nothing like I ever tasted in SG. Light red, slightly tangy, umami 💯, absolutely delicious 
- your plate will be at least $8 for a decent selection
- I always got the udang (prawns) and it's expensive so this place is a actually an occasional treat. Would fork out $12-15 for a plate with prawns - this is probably in 2014
- the prawns are not big, but really delicious and bouncy 🤤 they are stir fried in a sambal ish sauce
- stall is run by ladies, the one I saw often seemed pretty young
- they stopped operating around 2017 if I'm not wrong

I just wanna know where this stall went, or if i can find a similar place. Is the nasi padang at ION basement food court similar?

So why I'm asking is because a friend from overseas is visiting and i think they'll like those flavours. if anyone has recos for nasi padang can throw them my way. Also thinking of bringing them to Samy's Curry at Dempsey.",there was this nasi padang place at wisma food court some years ago with phenomenal chili. yall know what I'm referring to right

I personally wear a bra out and would like to not. however, I’m afraid I’d get long unsettling stares or looks. Maybe even sexualisation. Furthermore, if you have a bigger chest side, it might be worse. Most bras are uncomfortable and unflattering for certain outfit choices. 

Maybe that the 2 little protruding bumps might catch a glance or 2, but definitely there shouldn’t be straight up staring and weird looks.

singapore,"I've been living in Shanghai for the last 4 years for work. 

I'm considering a move to Singapore for work. 

Everything that I read about Singapore now is that its much more expensive than when I was there for work about 10 years ago. I think need to 1.5X - 2X on Comp to be about the same. I haven't been back since 2017 and I know a lot has changed.  

Anyone make the move before? Thoughts? 

**The goal is: Salary - Taxes - Rent - Food - Transportation - Ayi = Same Net Number without a decrease in quality of life.** 

**Important Recurring Expenses:** 

1. Taxes 
2. Rent 
3. Food / Transportation 
4. Ayi 

Office is at Suntec Towers (City Hall Area). 

**Rent + Utilities:** 2 BR about 1100 Square Feet in a good location I think is about 6K SGD / Month. (Novena, Outram Park, River Valley, Clarke Quay, Tanjong Pagar, Harbor Front areas). I currently pay the equivalent of 4K SGD for that in a super prime location in Shanghai. I think SG super prime is closer to 8K / Month.  SG is smaller than Shanghai by a lot though and from what I remember better traffic so location is not as much of an issue. Utilities I think SG is a lot more expensive. From what I remember its like 500 SGD a month. Utilities in Shanghai are nothing, maybe 100 sgd / month. 

**Food:** is about 2X Shanghai I think. Shanghai restaurant is about 75 SGD a head for something decent. From what I understand at SG its 150 sgd.  From what I remember of SG, drinking is really expensive - like 25 SGD a cocktail in Clarke Quay. Is that still right? Groceries are about 50% more. Cold Storage vs. City Super / HeMA. 

**Food Delivery:** Average food delivery meal here is about 20 SGD. As I understand in SG, it would be closer to 30. 

**Transportation -** Grab is about 2X-3X Didi Premier. My office commute is 6 SGD equivalent. As I understand Grab would be 12-15 SGD equivalent after all of the tolls and what not. Subway is 4X more expensive. 2.50 SGD a ticket i think. Shanghai subway costs 60 Cents SGD.  

**Ayi:** Ayi here is the equivalent of 300 SGD / Month for twice a week. Ayi in SG I understand is 600 SGD / month. 

**Taxes:** are about 3/8 of China (15% vs. 40%)  so there's important savings",Shanghai to Singapore for similar lifestyle?

Specifically would like to know about WLB in Singapore's tech industry(software developers, etc.). With the arrival of WFH, is WLB still bad or has it definitely improved compared to pre-COVID/WFH era?

singapore,"Singapore’s only mention in the World War Z book is when a Singapore-flagged ship that is beached in India gets snapped in two by another ship that was towing it. According to this [website](https://screenrant.com/world-war-z-2-movie-plot-cancelled-david-fincher/) (might not be trustable), Singapore would have appeared in the cancelled World War Z movie sequel. 

After rereading the book for the 3rd time, I decided to make this post because I’ve got nowhere else to put this story. Here is what I think happened to Singapore in both the book and the movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Movie Timeline, June 2013: Singapore is overrun by zombies very quickly. They swarm us from planes that crashed in Changi Airport or from Malaysia through our 2 land connections. Given how you become a zombie within 10s of being bitten, and that these zombies can run and pile up, there is no way that densely populated Singapore can survive. Small pockets of us that survive will definitely starve or die of thirst by the time the film’s events have ended. 

&amp;#x200B;

Book Timeline: The zombies in the book are traditionally slow zombies, and it takes anywhere from a few hours to several days before you turn into a zombie after being bitten. The zombies can only be killed with a headshot but are otherwise indestructible and don't decay. That gives us a slightly better chance of survival than in the film. 

(All international events mentioned below happened in the book, but all local events are made up by me.) 

&amp;#x200B;

2011- Early 2012: The zombie virus emerges in the Three Gorges Dam region of China. As the Chinese government covers it up, Singapore and the rest of the world are unaware of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

\~Jan - Mar 2012: The Chinese government initiates a huge crackdown on political dissidents and corruption, which in reality is used to purge the zombie outbreak. Human trafficking brings zombies outside of China to Central Asia, but Singapore is probably fine as we’re not a top smuggling destination. 

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Mar - Jun 2012: To deflect international attention, China stages a massive military buildup on Taiwan, creating a crisis. Singapore probably does its usual “we’re not taking sides and everyone should calm down” stance. Trafficked infected organs spread the infection worldwide. 

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Jun - Aug 2012: The world first properly learns of the zombies when an outbreak begins in a South African slum, however, the zombies are termed “African Rabies”. Our local media definitely uses that term for a time and covers it extensively, and our government probably made a statement about SARS and how we are prepared. 

Around this time, infected tourists bring the first “African Rabies” cases to Singapore, [making it the first time Singapore had a “rabies” case since 1953.](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/animals/animal-health-and-veterinarians/animal-diseases-and-antimicrobial-resistance/rabies#:~:text=What%20You%20Need%20To%20Know,been%20rabies%20free%20since%201953) Infected patients are obviously not down with rabies, and our healthcare workers probably realise that, but the government sticks to the stance that it is a new strain of rabies, not something else. Videos of infected patients circulate online (probably on STOMP or Facebook).

&amp;#x200B;

\~Sep - Oct 2012: Israel imposes a national quarantine, sealing up their borders, building walls and inviting all Jews and Palestinians to join them (this is the only part of the book that appears in the movie, but the movie version is very different). Given our ties, they might have warned Singapore that something is up with the “African Rabies”. The Muslim world (including our neighbours) condemns the move, but Singapore remains silent. 

Singapore probably implements SARS-era measures nationwide, with temperature screening, health declarations and PSAs about looking out for the symptoms. Unfortunately, a lot of healthcare workers are gonna get bitten and infected (this is not covered in the books but it definitely happened). Imagine SARS era “avoid the healthcare workers” behaviour, but a lot worse now. 

The Singapore government might decide to just straight up execute the zombified patients as there is really no hope of saving them (the book doesn’t cover what happens to zombified patients but I assume this is a common practice). 

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Nov 2012- Mar 2013: Phalanx, a vaccine for “African Rabies” hits the shelves. Singapore quickly buys stocks of them. However, the vaccine is a placebo and doesn’t work but people don’t realise that. Vaccination centres similar to COVID-19 ones pop up. Although global cases drop due to the northern hemisphere winter, Singapore bans flights from some countries like we did in the early days of COVID.

By this time, an outbreak involving new migrant workers probably happens, and due to their close quarters, it spreads quickly in their dorms. This causes a public outcry over their living conditions.

The worldwide economy starts to slowly recover from the recession caused by the outbreak. In the US, the Republican president wins a second term (in this timeline Obama doesn’t become president) and Singapore congratulations him. 

&amp;#x200B;

\~Apr - May 2013: An American newswoman breaks the news that the Phalanx vaccine is a sham and that the “African Rabies” is not a new form of rabies, but is literally zombies. “The Great Panic” ensues.  In Singapore, civil order is a lot better than in other countries, but the worst aspects of our culture emerge, with panic buying, people getting into fights over supplies etc. Singapore probably goes into an ultra-authoritarian, “martial law” mode, even more authoritarian than in the 60s to 70s. 

Reservists are definitely recalled back to maintain civil order and to kill the zombies within the country. Due to our built-up nature, zombies are easily found and killed, as they most likely reanimated in their homes. Riots break out in migrant worker dorms as they demand to go home but the Singapore government suppresses the riots. 

All our borders are sealed up, causing chaos at Changi Airport and our border crossings with Malaysia. ([In some WWZ fanfic](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/8ksp8e/cool_map_of_the_world_after_the_events_of_the/), this is how we survive the apocalypse, but the problem is that back in 2013, we imported 90% of our food, about half of our water and all of our energy. We cannot be sealed up forever.) 

For the first few weeks of “The Great Panic”, the water still flows from Malaysia, ships still pass by, and Indonesia still supplies us with gas, but the government knows this can’t last forever. Ironically, the Singapore navy becomes a “pirate fleet”, stopping all traffic in the Singapore Strait and seizing all the cargo onboard as the nation is going to need it. The rest of the world devolves into war, Pakistan and Iran have nuked each other and it's likely that Singapore “seizes” the gas pipeline from Indonesia and water supply from Malaysia amidst the chaos in those countries. 

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Jun 2013 - Jul 2013: After a few weeks of “a new normal”, Singapore’s situation becomes untenable. Waves of refugees flood the border crossings and boats attempt to land on our beaches. Zombies start crossing the Johor Straits and walking out of the waves on our beaches (zombies can walk on the sea floor in the book). The SAF is very overstretched trying to guard all of our coasts. Rationing is in place but supplies are running out. Zombies have breached our defences in several places as there are simply too many of them, especially along our northern coast. 

Singapore finally devolves into the panic seen in other countries as swarms of zombies flood Singapore from the north and south. The government evacuates to Sentosa as it is a lot easier to defend, but that leaves the majority of Singapore to die. 

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Aug 2013 - Oct 2013: Singapore’s 48th birthday passes with the nation effectively gone. The US loses the Battle of Yonkers against a swarm of millions of zombies, while South Korea loses a similar battle at Incheon. Small pockets of survivors live in the abandoned HDBs and other high-rises, which are very easy to defend, but impossible to resupply.

Other countries implement a similar move to Singapore, under a South African plan called the “Redeker Plan”. However, these countries have established “safe zones” for their populations, which in reality are used as bait to distract the zombies from the real safe zone. Singapore can’t afford to do that due to the inability of any safe zone to sustain itself in our environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Oct 2013 - 2017: For the next 4 years, the Sentosa Safe Zone ekes out a living on the island. The main goal is to try to outlast the zombies living on Singapore, with the end goal to liberate Singapore in the future. I predict that the forests on Sentosa are cut down and replaced by farmland, the hotels and resorts are used as housing. Singapore’s 50th birthday arrives in 2015, but only the few thousand on Sentosa are alive to celebrate it. 

In 2017, the Honululu Conference is held on the USS Saratoga, with 72 delegates. It is possible that a Singaporean delegate is among one of them. The US declared that it was going to go on the offensive and liberate the mainland of zombies, with other countries deciding to do so as well. The rest chose not to. Singapore would be among those that abstained, as it did not have the manpower to liberate the mainland. 

&amp;#x200B;

2017 - 2020: For the next 3 years, the US liberated its mainland, while other countries did the same. The US was declared liberated in 2020. Afterwards, the US helped to liberate Canada and Mexico. 

&amp;#x200B;

2020 - 2022: It is possible that in this timespan, a UN coalition force had liberated Singapore. As Singapore was very urbanised, it probably took a while to clear it of all the zombies hiding among the HDBs and the forests. Imagine BMT’s CQB room clearing but on a nationwide scale. 

Victory in China is declared in 2022, although pockets of zombies still remain. 

&amp;#x200B;

2032: This is the year that all the interviews in the book are recorded in. The world has been trying to recover from the war, Singapore as well. Of a pre-pandemic population of 5.4 million, I estimate that by this year there are probably only 10,000 remaining. Singapore is freed but mostly empty and abandoned. The remaining Singaporeans are government officials who evacuated to Sentosa, those who lived on Sentosa, and those who managed to make it there. 

&amp;#x200B;

u_coolcare-singapore,"It's no secret that Singapore is a hot and humid country. And when the temperatures start to soar, the last thing you want is for your air conditioner to conk out on you. That's why it's important to keep your AC unit in tip-top condition by regularly aircon servicing it and ensuring that it undergoes a chemical wash.

An [aircon chemical ](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/)wash is a deep cleaning of your AC unit that gets rid of all the dirt, grime, and build-up that has accumulated over time. Not only does this improve the efficiency of your AC unit, it also helps to extend its lifespan.

**So why exactly is a chemical wash so important? Here are 3 reasons:**

**1. It Keeps Your AC Unit Running Efficiently**

When your AC unit is clogged with dirt and grime, it has to work harder to cool your home. This not only makes it less energy-efficient but also puts a strain on the unit, which can lead to breakdowns.

An [aircon chemical wash ](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/)cleans out all the dirt and grime so that your AC unit can run more efficiently. This not only helps to keep your home cool, but it also helps to save you money on your energy bills.

**2. It Helps to Extend the Lifespan of Your AC Unit**

Just like any other appliance in your home, your AC unit has a lifespan. And the way you use and maintain it will affect how long it lasts.

If you don't take care of your AC unit, it will have to work harder and will break down more often. This will shorten its lifespan.

But if you regularly [aircon service](https://coolcare.com.sg/) your AC unit and ensure that it undergoes a chemical wash, it will last much longer. An aircon chemical wash helps to remove all the dirt and grime that can damage the unit, so it can run smoothly for years to come.

**3. It Keeps Your AC Unit Safe and Clean**

One of the main benefits of an [aircon chemical wash](https://coolcare.com.sg/chemical-wash/) is that it keeps your AC unit safe and clean.

All the dirt and grime that accumulates over time can be a breeding ground for bacteria and mould. This can not only cause respiratory problems, it can also damage the unit.

A chemical wash gets rid of all the dirt and grime, so your AC unit is free from bacteria and mould. This not only keeps you safe, it also keeps your AC unit in good condition.

So if you want to keep your AC unit in good condition, be sure to have it regularly serviced and undergo a chemical wash. This will keep it running efficiently, extend its lifespan and keep it safe and clean.

Cool Care[ aircon service](https://coolcare.com.sg/) will provide premium aircon chemical wash service with the best workmanship warranty.  Get service with us. For more details, Please reach us at +65 9002 4773.

2nd Experience: Was having issues with applying a card releated promo code on their mobile app, their CS agent gave me a web link and asked me to try keying in my card details. 

Said website automatically charged my card (which means i paid 25% more) without clicking me on the pay button. 

After abit of back and forth, they initially asked me to show them the price diff and they will refund me the difference but in subsequent emails walked backed on it.

Despite repeatedly asking  why was I charged without clicking on the pay button, they totally ignored my question and deflect by replying they will try asking the hotel for a refund (which I specifically said not to as the previous CS agent has tried and wasn't successful). 

I called them and finally got them to  acknowledge and agree that I shouldn't be charged without clicking the pay button. They sent an email to say they will investigate and get back to me within 48 hours. It has been more than 72 hours and no updates from them. Evertime we follow up, it is a different CS agent who has no idea what is going on.

Truly one of the worst service ever. So if you are going to book via them, be prepared for little to no support when things go wrong.

I know rebuilding will be a bit inconvenient for the next 2-3yrs but if the station can be rebuilt to the same 'standard' (by that I mean bring the old MRT section up-to-date) it would be more pleasant and show-off our MRT system to tourists as 'world-class'

NCCS Response to the Repeal of Section 377A of the Penal Code and the Enactment of Article 156 of the Constitution

1 The National Council of Churches of Singapore (NCCS) notes the legislative amendments enacted at the Parliamentary sitting on 29 Nov 2022, namely, the repeal of Section 377A of the Penal Code and the enactment of Article 156 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.

2 We refer to our earlier statement “Response to Government’s Decision on the Repeal of Section 377A” issued on 21 Aug 2022.

3 The NCCS continues to be concerned about the possible repercussions of the repeal of Section 377A. As highlighted in our earlier statement, we urge the Government to remain watchful on possible moves to restrict the right of religious groups and individuals to “profess, practice and propagate” our religion (to use the language of Article 15 of our Constitution). If necessary, we hope the government would be swift to take legislative and administrative steps to counter these moves and preserve religious liberty as currently practiced in Singapore. In this regard, NCCS appreciates Minister K Shanmugam’s assurance that the law ministry was looking at ways to deal with the harm caused by cancel culture, and Minister Masagos Zulkifli’s assurance of religious freedom for individuals to practise as their own religion states in relation to this issue.

4 With regard to the constitutional amendment to protect the definition of marriage against legal challenge, our preference is for the Government to adopt the more robust safeguard of expressing the current definition of marriage within the Constitution, as recommended in our earlier statement. However, we appreciate and support the enactment of Article 156, which shields the current definition of marriage as that between a man and a woman (and laws and policies formed on this basis) from being struck down by the judiciary on the grounds that they violate the provisions of Part 4 of the Constitution.

5 We are also reassured by the statement made by our Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong that the current government is committed to upholding family-centred policies and that “the overall tone of our society will not change” with the repeal of Section 377A (Interview with CNA, 22 Aug 2022).

6 The NCCS remains fully committed to the stability and flourishing of our nation and will continue its endeavours to enhance the health of marriages and the well-being of families in Singapore.

7 Therefore, we encourage our churches to spare no effort to spiritually form our members, such that they will imbibe ever more deeply the Christian narrative, see things according to the Christian perspective and make decisions according to our Christian values. This is our best defence against the counter-narratives and perspectives that daily confront us from a variety of sources. As an integral part of our Christian witness, we should also continue to show love and offer empathetic help to those with same-sex attractions or who are in homosexual relationships, as a visible sign of God’s love and concern for them. Finally, let us never cease to offer our earnest prayers for this small nation-state that we call home.

https://nccs.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NCCS-Statement-20221205.pdf

I’m pleasantly surprised about the statement of extending love and empathy to those in homosexual relationships. Granted they may not be affirming, but it’s better than suggesting that such couples don’t deserve love until they repent and break up.

This part baffles me, though: “we urge the Government to remain watchful on possible moves to restrict the right of religious groups and individuals to “profess, practice and propagate” our religion”

Who do they think those moves would be coming from, and what does it have to do with the repeal? LGBTQ organizations here are extremely conscious when it comes to not disrupting religious harmony, especially because many LGBTQ people are religious ourselves or have partners/friends/loved ones who are. Plus a lot of us here belong to LGBTQ Christian and Muslim groups such as Free Community Church, Quasa and the Healing Circle, and wouldn’t support let alone propose policies that restrict our own ability to freely practice our religion.",National Council of Churches statement on 377A repeal

singapore,"Hi everyone, just wanted to have a discussion and also a PSA on the risks of SIM swapping in Singapore. My post was removed previously as I went into details on how to perform the attack so here's an abridged version without a step-by-step guide on how to become a criminal. 

Background: SIM Swapping attacks is when a cyber criminal takes over your SIM card and use that to take over your accounts. As these requires precise maneuvers, it's not realistic to do a blanket general attack and works well targeting specific individuals. 

As the adversary, you would find a target, preferably someone who is involved in cryptocurrencies as money-laundering is extremely through BTC/ETH/USDT tumbers. Finding a target is trivial if you know how to dig for information online. 

After obtaining key information, the next bit is the most important: taking over the target's SIM card. With an NRIC, phone number and name, it's trivial to find the required information to take over the target's SIM card. You can find the target's telco by using the web portal of any telco. Login via Starhub, SingTel via phone number or NRIC. Telcos like redONE, TPG, CMLink, Singtel, Starhub, M1 will tell you if the NRIC/phone number is registered under their company. 

Here's the important part: sign up with TPG (Simba) and request for number porting. I use TPG as the postman DOES NOT check the NRIC and simply delivers it as normal mail to you. This is a major issue as there's absolutely no security checks here. 

As SIM card porting happens at 12am to avoid service disruption, it also gives the adversary a time span of almost 6hrs to perform the hack. This is more than enough time for an experienced adversary to take over your entire net worth if you're not careful. 

Key weaknesses:

* Telco companies not securing their number porting process. No telco right now requires a photo of you holding your IC for number porting or new sign-ups. TPG does not even require actual verification upon delivery. (TPG please wake up your idea)
* Telco companies giving away private information. With any number/NRIC in Singapore, it's almost trivial to check what telco the target is using.
* Lack of 2FA on most platforms. Grab, EZ-Link, Shoppee, ShopBack, Fave and Singtel Dash do NOT support 2FA. Only a few of those listed above supports SingPass which is a much more secure way of logging in.
* Allowing p2p to continue to exist: Singapore is not stamping this out and unfortunately this is a legitimate way to get hacked. What the government should do is legitimise this and require SingPass to register an account, rendering fake accounts almost impossible.

How to protect yourself:

* Get a burner number for PayNow, or stop using PayNow all together. Use bank account numbers directly.
* Use a private number for services and another public number for communication. This does not prevent data leaks from these services leaking your private number though.
* Stop using SMS OTP and stick to 2FA like Authy, KeepassXC.
* Use a password manager like Bitwarden. Seriously it's 2022, everyone should use a password manager.
* Use a email forwarder like AnonAddy. Buying Protonmail's premium package also bundles such services for you so you won't be exposed in the event of an email leaks. 

What service providers (and governments) should do:

* Stop outsourcing security to SMS OTP which is basically Swiss Cheese (full of holes). The telcos DO NOT care about security, not to mention SMS is unencrypted and unsecure. Even using email OTP is safer than SMS OTP.
* Use SingPass as the OTP delivery provider. SingPass has an inbox feature which I find is a much needed gap between full blown 2FA and SMS OTP. Logging into SingPass requires a face scan and your account is disabled after multiple password attempts. By outsourcing the security to SingPass, most services can be locked down fairly easily. EZ-Link has the option to login via SingPass but does not mandate SingPass login and does not use the inbox feature either.
* Allow end users to use 2FA. None of the service providers above allows 2FA which is beyond me.
* Allow end users to disable SMS OTP. No point in using 2FA/SingPass if SMS OTP can still be used.
* Banks should allow users to choose another number for PayNow. I want to use a public number for PayNow and a private number for OTPs from the bank.

Please let me know if I have anything wrong. This subreddit has a lot more savvy users and it'd be interesting to hear improvements and discussions on this topic.

P.P.S. I'm up for hire :)",Discussion on SIM swap attack
singapore,,US Embassy flying the US flag at half mast
singapore,"Hi everyone, just wanted to have a discussion and also a PSA on the risks of SIM swapping in Singapore. 

Background: SIM Swapping attacks is when a cyber criminal takes over your SIM card and use that to take over your accounts. As these requires precise maneuvers, it's not realistic to do a blanket general attack and works well targeting specific individuals. Here's an example of how I would go about doing that. Skip the next portion if you don't want to read the details. 

As the adversary, you would find a target, preferably someone who is involved in cryptocurrencies as money-laundering is extremely through Bitcoin/ETH tumbers. I'll talk more about this later. How do you find a target? By posing as a p2p seller on Huobi or Binance. p2p is where you buy and sell directly to other people just like carousell. By registering an account with a fake KYC by photoshopping a fake identity card, phone number and email, you have successfully evaded the platform's security checks. Next, start selling USDT (a form of cryptocurrency) and request for the person's IC for security. This is a common practice in the p2p circle. You can also state that you only accept PayNow, meaning that they'll provide their phone number to you. Now, you have both the IC and the phone number of this person. 

The next part is easy, photoshop a proper IC with the person's photo. This can be done fairly easily with the IC, plus some social media crawling. With some luck, you may also find the person's email address on social media. You could even buy leaked data off the dark web etc and if you're lucky, you find the person's email and other info. If not, it's not too important since Gmail allows you to sign in with phone number, along with other platforms. To find the telco the target is using, login via Starhub, SingTel etc via phone number or NRIC. Telcos like redONE, TPG, CMLink, Singtel, Starhub, M1 will tell you if the NRIC/phone number is registered under their company. 

Here's the important part: sign up with TPG (Simba) with the IC and use a mailing address (not sure if it works) or a mule's mailing address. Request for number porting. I'm fairly sure that mailing addresses are not filtered in TPG's system. I use TPG as TPG DOES NOT check the NRIC and simply delivers it as normal mail to you, meaning that there is no checks by the postman when the SIM card is delivered. 

As SIM card porting happens at 12am to avoid service disruption, it also gives the adversary a time span of almost 6hrs to perform the hack. Emptying bank accounts may be more difficult, but e-wallets usually have much fewer security checks. Grab for one does not enable any other security checks besides the mandatory SMS OTP. Gmail, Microsoft Outlook also enables SMS recovery, meaning email accounts can be taken over fairly easily as well. With both email and phone number and almost 6hrs to perform the necessary hacks, an experienced adversary can quite literally take over the person's entire net worth. 

How to money launder? With access to e-wallets and master/visa cards, buy gift cards with these stolen cards. Gift cards can be blocked by Google and Apple, but other companies may find it more difficult to block gift cards. Topping up Apple and Google accounts with these gift cards and buying cryptocurrency off exchanges should also be fairly trivial. If the cryptocurrency exchange chosen supports debit card purchases, buying them is even simpler. Since the target is a user of cryptocurrency exchanges, it's even simpler to just try entering crypto exchanges and withdrawing whatever money is in there. Once they are withdrawn, they can be washed with tornado cash and other crypto tumblers.

Key weaknesses: 

* Telco companies not securing their number porting process. No telco right now requires a photo of you holding your IC for number porting or new sign-ups. TPG does not even require actual verification upon delivery.
* Telco companies giving away private information. With any number/NRIC in Singapore, it's almost trivial to check what telco the target is using. 
* Lack of 2FA on most platforms. Grab, EZ-Link, Shoppee, ShopBack, Fave and Singtel Dash do NOT support 2FA. Only a few of those listed above supports SingPass which is a much more secure way of logging in. 
* Allowing p2p to continue to exist: Singapore is not stamping this out and unfortunately this is a legitimate way to get scammed.

How to protect yourself:

* Get a burner number for PayNow, or stop using PayNow all together. Use bank account numbers directly. 
* Use a private number for services and another public number for communication. This does not prevent data leaks from these services leaking your private number though. 
* Stop using SMS OTP and stick to 2FA like Authy, KeepassXC. 
* Use a password manager like Bitwarden. Seriously it's 2022, everyone should use a password manager. 

What service providers (and governments) should do: 

* Stop outsourcing security to SMS OTP which is basically Swiss Cheese (full of holes). The telcos don't care about security, not to mention SMS is unencrypted and not secure. Even using email OTP is safer than SMS OTP. 
* Use SingPass as the OTP delivery provider. SingPass has an inbox feature which I find is a much needed gap between full blown 2FA and SMS OTP. Logging into SingPass requires a face scan and your account is disabled after multiple password attempts. By outsourcing the security to SingPass, most services can be locked down more easily than ever. 
* Allow end users to use 2FA. None of the service providers above allows 2FA which is beyond me. 
* Allow end users to disable SMS OTP. No point in using 2FA/SingPass if SMS OTP can still be used.

singapore,"I really believe in investing in handbags and it's actually how I financed a big part of my studies at ESSEC Singapore. I'm a Data Scientist and I basically spend my days just scraping handbag data, cleaning it, and finally evaluating it, in order to make the right investment decision when buying or selling a handbag. What's so interesting about handbags is that there is a clear market price to them in the resell market, the problem is just that no one really knows where it's at, because if you go on websites such as Vestiaire Collective or The Real Real, the prices are just all over the place. I'll try and post regularly and keep you up to date with the data that I find and the interesting investments that come to mind.

Let me give you a more concrete example! The summary on the LV Pochette Metis: 

* **Average Sale Price:** S$2'513 
* **12-month trade range:** S$2'334 - S$2'741 
* **Volatility:** 2.48% 
* **Retail Price:** S$2'785 
* **Last Sale:** S$2'506 on 17 November 2022 
* **Number of Data Points:** 17 

Obviously the first thing that jumps right out from those numbers is that the resell price is ridiculously close to the retail price, if the item is kept in good condition. That's really promising, because handbags are generally not a very liquid asset. Like any asset that's not liquid, if you know the market price, you can use this to your advantage. If you stumble across a seller that wants to let go of their LV Pochette Metis, it's likely that they are willing to let it go below the 'market price' of S$2'513. That's because of a concept known as delayed gratification. The seller is aware that the item can be sold at S$2'513, if they find the right buyer. But the less liquid an asset is, the harder this becomes to put into practice. Therefore, if you offer them a price below the market price, but it allows them to turn their item into cash (liquidity) immediately, they are likely to let go of it. I purchased 2 LV Pochette Metis so far, each at S$1'900. Personally, I was in no time pressure to sell off the item, so after 2 and 3 months respectively, I sold the items at S$2'505 and S$2'583 on Vestiaire Collective and FB Marketplace.",How I financed my lifestyle during my studies at ESSEC Singapore by investing in luxury bags

singapore,"I enjoy potato chips as an occasional indulgence and Lays is usually the brand I go for. For as long as I can remember the chips sold in SG were made in and imported from the US. Not anymore it seems, at least at NTUC… says on the back of the packaging that the chips are manufactured by PepsiCo China’s factories in Shanghai. This goes for the entire lineup: The plain Lays chips in the yellow packaging, Ruffles, and everything else.

I don’t know when or why NTUC made the switch. Cost-cutting seems like the obvious reason, but a large China-made Lays costs a little over $5, about 50 cents pricier than the US-made Lays that had its price fixed at around ~$4.50 for many years. Adjust the price of the US-made Lays for inflation and it’d probably touch $5 in 2022, so the price would likely be about the same as the China-made Lays in the current year.

I don’t have anything against China-made products with the exception of edible goods for safety and quality reasons, esp if those goods have a strong cultural association with a certain region since their inception. Cadbury chocolate for example is notably poorer in quality if it’s sourced from India/Thailand/US versus Britain/Australia/NZ, and no-one in their right mind would source Scotch whiskey from anywhere but the source country.

Is the Lays switch specific to NTUC or is it a country-wide thing at this point?",(Question) NTUC seems to have switched its entire Lays potato chips lineup to the China-made version. Where in Singapore can you find the original US-made Lays potato chips?

singapore,"Greetings /r/singapore,

Over two years ago, with COVID setting in and travel impossible, [I asked for your help in finding food from every Chinese province in Singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/lgubaf/help_me_find_food_from_every_chinese_province_in/).  You delivered in spades, and now, after **visiting 112 restaurants, failing to visit 5 more, sampling 13 packaged snacks or drinks and eating 6 dinners with random Redditors, my quest is finally complete**.  Here are the top three times three from along the way:

# Best restaurants

* **Alijiang** (阿里疆), from the Xinjiang and Ningxia episodes. You’d think the food from a flashy Chinese chain with turquoise plastic camels outside and avocado-lobster salad on the menu would be terrible, but you won’t be disappointed if you stick to the Xinjiang side of the menu: these guys really know how to cook lamb.
* **BBQ City** (东北菜馆), from the Heilongjiang episode. Of all the places I went to, this is the one you’d never find by accident, since it’s lurking on the upper floors of an industrial warehouse in Bukit Batok. Catering squarely to northeastern Chinese, the food is great, and the great company and expert guidance made it even better!
* **Plum Village** (梅村酒家), from the Guangdong episode. Astonishingly, this appears to be the only Hakka restaurant remaining in all Singapore. Everything about the place is a time warp to days long gone, down to the prices and the home-style cooking: family food, made with love.

# Best meals

* Chengdu-style mala hotpot at **Shuguo Yinxiang Hotpot** (蜀国印象-火锅) in Johor Bahru, literally just across the Causeway. Really, really good (having a pro do the ordering helped!), and you can sample forbidden-in-Singapore delicacies like duck intestines and blood tofu.
* Beijing food at **Hand in Hand Beijing Restaurant** (手拉手京华小馆), Jalan Besar. There’s nothing fancy about this place or the food they serve, but the dumplings and meat pies I had here were better than anything I had in Beijing itself.
* Guizhou home cooking with **@ appropriateamount** (Instagram) -- she's also a Redditor, but I won't doxx her!  Amazing dishes and tasty new flavours like fish mint (鱼腥草) and tree ginger oil (木姜子), here’s hoping her private dining plans take off.

# Best new flavours

* **Tofu brain** (豆腐脑 *dòufunǎo*) from **Guangjuren Xiaochu** (广聚仁小厨), in the Tianjin episode. “When I dipped in my spoon and ate my first bite, the heavens parted and an angelic choir sang. This is what my crazy quest is all about! The tofu was still warm, bathed in a mildly salty, mildly sweet broth, with coriander, pickled radish, a mysterious but zingy green sauce and a central dab of dark black mala sauce, with that Sichuan pepper crunch and just the right amount of chilli kick.”
* **Lanzhou beef noodles** (蘭州牛肉拉面 *Lánzhōu niúròu lāmiàn*) from **Western Mahua** (西部马华), in the Gansu episode. I had dozens of bowls of various noodles along the way, and I’ve had lamian before, but this was just on an entirely new level, made to order, simple and perfect.
* **Rattan Pepper Chicken Rice Noodle** (藤椒鸡米线 *téngjiāo jī mǐxiàn*) from **Mademoiselle Tang Noodle** (唐大小姐), in the Yunnan episode. The noodles here were ordinary, what blew away my tastebuds was téngjiāo (藤椒), the fresh pods of the green Sichuan pepper, crunchy and intensely ma-flavored (more on what that means in Sichuan). Paired up with equally fresh red chilli padi, this was the kind of intense real-Thai-level flavour you can feel heating your stomach for hours afterwards.

I've also written a [wrap-up with random honorable mentions and some parting thoughts](https://driftingclouds.net/2022/12/07/34-province-project-wrap-up/), plus a special [vegetarian regional Chinese food index](https://driftingclouds.net/2022/11/26/34-province-project-vegetarian-chinese-food-in-singapore/) (yes, there's more out there than cai png with gluten dyed to look like meat).  For completeness, here are the four final provinces since the [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/uwrz80/finding_food_from_every_chinese_province_in/):

* [34 Province Project: Hunan 湖南](https://driftingclouds.net/2022/11/24/34-province-project-hunan-%e6%b9%96%e5%8d%97/) \-- there's more to it than just chillies
* [34 Province Project: Shandong 山東](https://driftingclouds.net/2022/11/06/34-province-project-shandong-%e5%b1%b1%e6%9d%b1/) -- I like big baos and I cannot lie
* [34 Province Project: Sichuan 四川](https://driftingclouds.net/2022/08/10/34-province-project-sichuan-%e5%9b%9b%e5%b7%9d/) \-- featuring a trip across the Causeway to sample forbidden meat
* [34 Province Project: Liaoning 辽宁](https://driftingclouds.net/2022/05/28/34-province-project-liaoning-%e8%be%bd%e5%ae%81/) \-- Manchurian lamb spines and more

And that, dear reader, is all: as I write this, there are less than ten days to go before my ten years in Singapore come to an end and I bugger off back to Australia.

It is weird that only now they complained of this issue and let the agent know, and the agent is pestering my parents  to fix it.

Two things come to mind:

1) agent didn’t check the house properly when previous tenant hand over keys? 


2) not accusing current tenants broke the thing,  but they had one month to let us know of any issues. But they only notified us of this issue almost 2 months in. I’m baffled why the agent thinks my parents should fix this issue…

singapore,"TLDR below. 

As the title states. To me, these are some of the worst people and it is so triggering. Some people may feel that this is such a petty issue or i’m being sensitive and i feel that it is so ingrained into us(me) to just let them be and just tolerate, especially to old people. Honestly i just want to shout at the top of my lungs “F*** OFF” to them. 

This afternoon, i was queuing to buy caipng and in front of me was a grab deliveryman(GDM) and in front of him was an auntie(A). So i queue and scrolled facebook. Next moment an auntie(B) stood beside the queue and was probably talking to A. Then the line moved forward and this auntie asked the GDM if he was queuing caipng then proceeds to stand behind him and IN FRONT OF ME. Wa i was livid man, so i ask B what she was queuing and she say “caipng” and i asked “why she cut queue.” She say “no lah i was standing beside A”.

She then try to gaslight me by saying “if you in a hurry i let you go first lor, i nevermind one.” AUNTIE, YOU CUT MY GODDAMN QUEUE. &lt;- is what i want to say. In the end i say “you go ahead. You go ahead.” and rolled my eyes but what i really wanted to say was “you go ahead, i have time. But you dont.”

If she had asked nice. Heck, if she just looked at me to acknowledge that I’m behind the GDM i would have let her go ahead of me if there was no one behind. These people who just cut are so entitled, so spoiled and so far up their asses that its appalling and deserved to be called out. Always using their age or gaslighting you to save time queuing from the back of the line. Especially if you look young or easy or both.

So sometimes i envy people who dont give a damn and just say what they want and/or tell people off.

Thanks for reading my long rant.

TLDR: Auntie try to cut queue, act like nobody behind and try to gaslight me.",What do you guys think about people who cut queue? (Rant/Opinion)

singapore,"By most Singaporean metrics, I have a good life. I am able to support my siblings while they're studying, bring my family on holidays once in a while, and have no debt. I don't have terrible working condition or outrageous OT. Yet what we call a good life is far from an ideal life. 

We are subjected to competition from a young age. Everything a kid does has to be beneficial to applying for a secondary school, to JC and then to uni. That's just the start. We have one of the longest work week in the world and one of the most stressed out workforce. If you're lucky, you get a 45-50 hours, 5 days work week, before even factoring the fact that most people don't get the luxury of leaving the office at the official hour. 

We are constantly told that we must go above and beyond for our companies, that Singaporeans must work hard and be subjected to competition to remain competitive. Doing just the work that you're paid for is ""quiet quitting"" and is shameful. When someone dared to mention the possibility of a 4 days work week or having the right to disconnect, everyone and their mothers were up in arms about ""the impact on productivity"", even though none of the increase in productivity in the previous decades have been passed onto the workers. Let's not forget how we're ""encouraged"" to remain active in old age by upgrading our skills and working more. 

Houses are getting smaller while at the same time, getting more out of reach for most. If you're not lucky to have found love in your early 20s, have fun waiting for your BTOs. Of course, you could turn to the resale market where all your savings get turned into ~~profit~~ retirement fund for the lucky ones who got there before you (but don't worry, only 1% of people own both a private and HDB property). Of course, no one questions why a resale market exist for public housing or why it's doing the job of generating retirement fund, instead of CPF. 

So, a kid is subjected to stress from a young age, devote his entire life to work, after hours and on weekends, continue to work past retirement, all for a 30 years mortgage on an apartment that should only be big enough to have sex and raise more kids. Who the f\*\*\* looks at this and say ""Wow, this is the life that I want my kids to have"". And mind you, this is a picture of a decent life. God forbid if he was born poor, or LGBT or want to be single. 

I have since understood the broader ethics about antinatalism which has nothing to do with the Singaporean context. But even if I ignore all ethical questions about having a kid, I could never find it in my conscience to subject a person to the life here.",How Singapore helped me realise that I do not want kids

singapore,"Context: My Carousell account (let's just call it A) is over 4 years old and I used it almost daily to buy and sell items. I have never broken any terms of service and have hundreds of positive 5 star reviews.

A few days ago, I opened Carousell and found that I cannot log in. I contacted Carousell and after 1-2 days, I received an email from them stating that ""your account A has been suspended due to at least 1 unresolved transaction in your other account B"" and that I need to resolve the issue relating to account B for them to unsuspend account A.

However, I do not own the other account B. Hence, I have been mistakenly linked to account B, and my account A has been wrongfully suspended with no means to resolve the issues relating to account B which I have no access to.

I then contacted Carousell multiple times explaining that account B is not my account and to check device ID and IP addresses associated with each account which will show that the owners of both accounts are not the same person. However, they continue to insist that the owners of both accounts are related/the same, are unable to explain how they arrived at this conclusion, and refuse to unsuspend my account A unless I resolve issues related to account B which is impossible for me.

Now for the second part. Why am I losing money? This is because I have pre-ordered a number of items (each worth hundreds of dollars) from different sellers using account A, where I have paid a deposit to them. Without access to account A, I have lost all my chat history with these sellers. I am forced to create a new account to try to contact these sellers again, prove my identity and secure my pre-order. While some sellers have been cooperative, some have yet to reply/doubt my identity, which means that some of the deposits I paid previously may be wasted, adding up to $1000.

They have also banned my device ID, which means I can no longer use Carousell on my phone even if I delete and reinstall the app and clear app data.

This is completely outrageous. I have done absolutely nothing wrong and yet my account has been suspended and my device has been banned from using Carousell. Their customer support is also incompetent, making false allegations and not being able to provide any evidence to back up the ridiculous conclusion they have arrived at. List and deal on Carousell at your own risk as they may one day suspend your account without any warning. Any advice is welcome. Thanks for reading.

tldr: Carousell suspended my account A because they claim that my other account B has an unresolved transaction. I do not own account B but they keep insisting that I own both accounts and refuse to unsuspend account A. I lost my chat history so the deposit money I paid to some sellers using account A may be wasted adding up to $1000.",Carousell has wrongfully suspended my account without any warning causing me to potentially lose $1000

This is despite the mrt being packed, with no way to stand near the doors (at least until the doors open and the people can move along). So much impatience to exit the mrt 😤 Probably the worst case I've seen was a young man almost double the size of the petite lady in front of him literally shoving her against the open mrt doors so that he can push his way into the mrt (she was in front of him, waiting for those in the mrt to exit first).

singapore,"So my wife and I are planning to move back to Singapore late 2023 or early 2024 so she can be closer to her family.

I have always said I'd love to move there as I love the place from the time we've spent there so far but she likes to scare me with warnings that Singapore has a ""steryotypical asian work culture"" in that you arrive early and leave late, usually after the boss does and that it's nothing like working in the UK and is high pressure and not fun.

Currently I work in finance technology at an investment bank in London and there is a big focus on healthy work/life balance and friendly work culture here. 

We regularly have team events like board games after work in the office or at someones house and we go for drinks/lunch together and I would describe my colleagues as essentially a group of friends.

We are given free reign over our time as long as we get our work done and we can come in and leave early/late whenever we want and take time out of our days for whatever we need. Most of us work from home 2-3 days a week and there is no micromanagement. There is a big emphesis on us being trusted so we are essntially managing ourselves.

This has led to us being way ahead of targets and one of the best performing teams in our division.

I have experience before this in another team in the same firm that was very different. It was very stressful with unrealistic targets and lots of micromanaging going on. I absolutely hated it and was very depressed and on the verge of quitting before I moved to this new team.

My wife says most offices in Singapore will be like my old team, however she has never worked in banking/fintech or even an office space in Singapore so I'm not 100% convinced in what she's telling me.

Can anyone in this industry shed some light on what the work culture is like there please?

Also if anyone in the banking/fintech industry feels comfortable sharing their salary with me I would be really interested to know what it's like in comparison to mine in London as I can't find many accurate figures online and I'd like to be able to plan our finances way ahead of time.

I suppose I should go first if I'm asking for this kind of info - I make £85k +bonus with 4 years of experience. I am expecting a slight decrease once we move as London is known for being a high paying city.",What is the working culture like in Singapore offices? Mainly finance/technology/banking

2nd Experience: Was having issues with applying a card releated promo code on their mobile app, their CS agent gave me a web link and asked me to try keying in my card details. 

Said website automatically charged my card (which means i paid 25% more) without clicking on the pay button. 

After abit of back and forth, they initially asked me to show them the price diff and they will refund me the difference but in subsequent emails walked backed on it.

 I kept asking them why was I charged without clicking on the pay button, they totally ignored my question and replied they will try asking the hotel for a refund (which I specifically said not to as the previous Cs agent has tried and wasn't successful). 

I called them and finally got them to  acknowledge and agree that I shouldn't be charged without clicking the pay button. Sent an email to say they will investigate and get back to me within 48 hours. It has been more than 72 hours and no updates from them.

Truly one of the worst service ever. So if you are going to book via them, be prepared for little to no support when things go wrong.

Oh yeah I read complaints about their pay later option as well. Apparently there are additional charges as well so beware.",PSA: Be wary when booking with Agoda

singapore,"Back in secondary school, I used to be bullied by a guy named Izaac\* (not his real name). Due to a medical condition, I was overweight and had severe acne. We were assigned to sit together. All because he didn't get to sit with his friends and found me ""boring"", he started bullying me. 

Throwing his rubbish on my table like used tissues. Calling me names like ""ugly zhu ba jie (pig)"", ""smelly dirty b\*\*\*h"", ""better off dead"". Stealing my things. Purposely not giving me things like homework as the class rep. Humiliating me in front of the class by making a fuss about sitting next to me and saying I was ""diseased"". Asking his friends what they would do if I confessed to them, and them being disgusted and saying they'd beat a disgusting ""tr\*nny"" like me.

To cope, I started skipping school to avoid the bullying and my grades fell. I developed social anxiety and would fake sick to avoid all social situations I ate even more to cope. I stopped going out because I felt I was too ugly to be seen.

It's been many years since then. The other day, I found out Izaac was doing well. He graduated from a prestigious university and is earning way beyond what I can reach.

I thought I would feel horrible hearing how well he was doing, while I was still living with all these scars. I'm borderline underweight now but still wear big clothes, and I have a skin picking disorder. I am still socially anxious and have low self-esteem.

But it sobered me up. I don't want to live so pathetically, while he gets to live his best life without any care for what he did. **So please, for those who were also bullied in school, share with me how far you've come. I just want to hear your stories and know there's hope for someone like me.**",To those who were victims of bullying in school: please share how far you've come.

singapore,"Each year, the government strategy division publishes a report that includes updated population data. It generates some interesting insights, especially about government policy around social hot topic issues (housing, tax, immigration).

I've included some of the most interesting ones below:

[Our citizen population is extremely top heavy - boomers are going into retirement and there aren't enough people \&lt;25 years old entering the workforce to replace them.](https://preview.redd.it/18quaa6dtt2a1.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d8425cea6532bf734018f5842bee6313bc68481)

[There are increasingly fewer working adults per non-working adults. This means the tax burden on working adults has to keep on increasing unless we add more residents. Since non-working adults don't produce income but continue to consume, GST increases   make sense in raising revenue from non-working adults, whereas income tax increase would put the load on working adults.](https://preview.redd.it/ynsg0h1mtt2a1.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40bf68439c6dc730f99b429510c3f57d005d8d4f)

[Median marriage rate and marriage age seems fairly stable. Hard to tell whether trend is statistically significant without more data.](https://preview.redd.it/c5qdfpb2ut2a1.png?width=561&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06abb10bd1e8ee261b29e46483c767f370d623e6)

[More people are not having kids than before, but surprisingly \~75&amp;#37; of those who get married have at least one kid. This could explain government policy in prioritising housing for married couples \(regardless of intentions to have children\).](https://preview.redd.it/qgssnw8dut2a1.png?width=565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=782c9873a641219315f06dead65294c2c753c04b)

[Most non-citizen residents \(PRs\) are aged 30-60, and seem to be spread across ages in a way that evens out our working population. If we keep to the trend of maintaining our # of working population, we are looking at introducing \~100k new residents when those aged 0-4 in 2022 come of age around 2045. Such a policy will maintain our old-age support ratio, but if it is executed as such, it will be very controversial.](https://preview.redd.it/q7dhktswwt2a1.png?width=465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fa6652a8a8d32048890a2a862efbbe729f18096)

singapore,"Hey! for context. So it was after o levels and I decided to find a job. A FnB company happened to be hiring so I decided to go for it. The company is under a branch of companies that operates other well-known FnB companies here in Singapore. (I am not gonna disclose the company or anything). The hiring of 30-40 people is for one outlet, not several outlets.

The problem here is I was given one day of work this week. It was not even for workplace work but rather for the basic food hygiene course. So obviously after o levels, I am rather free and have nothing to do so I placed my availability to be free every day and all the time.  So when I found out the work schedule for the next week, I was even more shocked/upset to find out that they were overstaffed. My initial thoughts were that they placed us based on competency as I attended their training, however, evaluating a person just based on training seemed unpractical as the person is placed into real situations such as working under pressure and attitude when the outlet has begun operation. My question is, is it normal to even hire so many staff at one shot? Because I find this creates competition for shifts and some might fall behind others due to the lack of experience. I find it so unpractical to hire so many people and give some of us little to no shifts. Why does one outlet require so many part-timers with full-timers at the same time?",Is hiring 30-40 people a red flag for a company?

singapore,"I saw Ho Ching’s reply to a comment on her Facebook page today that got me thinking a lot. The question is as such:

&gt;I’ve a burning question for ma’am.  
&gt;  
&gt;How much of the NIRC is cash accretive?  
&gt;  
&gt;52% of TH portfolio is in unlisted assets and it appears that these are marked to market based on last valuation.  
&gt;  
&gt;So there could be an unrealized gain on that investment…how is that converted to cash to help the NIRC to fund gov annually?

Ho Ching's reply was:

&gt;Coming back to your question on where Singov gets the cash to spend under the NIRC rule.  
&gt;  
&gt;From the NIRC perspective, there is a difference between the cash for spending, and the authorised spending capacity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Singov is authorised to spend up to 50% of the expected long term returns of GIC, MAS and Temasek.  
&gt;  
&gt;This gives Singov extra headroom above the revenues and taxes collected by Singov.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is the spending capacity.  
&gt;  
&gt;And how does Singov get the cash to spend?  
&gt;  
&gt;So far, Singov does not need to require Temasek to sell assets and realise cash to give to Singov for spending under the NIRC account.  
&gt;  
&gt;For instance, Singov sells land for housing, industries, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;So Singov collects S$10-15B a year from such land sales, more in good times and less in economic downturns.  
&gt;  
&gt;So Singov could use cash from such sales so long as it is within the NIRC capacity limit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Any balance from land sales is then locked away as past reserves.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ordinarily, all land sales net proceeds must be locked up as past reserves.  
&gt;  
&gt;Next, Singov itself has investments from its reserves which can yield dividends from equity investments or interest payments from bond investments.  
&gt;  
&gt;Singov could tap this cash source up to the NIRC limit, and lock away the balance as past reserves.  
&gt;  
&gt;If they don’t have the NIRC licence, they would have to lock away all of these dividends and interest payments as past reserves under the NIRC framework.  
&gt;  
&gt;Next, as a company, Temasek pays dividends to MOF as its shareholder.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, such dividends are intended to be locked away as past reserves (as a result of Temasek coming into the NIRC framework).  
&gt;  
&gt;And again, Singov can spend this up the the limit of the NIRC, and the balance is locked away as past reserves.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hence, Singov has so far not required Temasek to sell part of its portfolio to support Singov NIRC spending.  
&gt;  
&gt;Knowing this, we also know that the 50% NIRC rule also means we are saving less for the future, and hence will be growing our reserves at a slower pace by taking out money to spend under the NIRC framework.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is quite apart from the likely lower returns environment with higher risk in the coming decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope i have understood your question and this helps answer your question.

This is a new revelation to me on how Singov actually gets the NIRC proceeds. TL;DR of Ho Ching’s answer:

1. Temasek doesn’t liquidate holdings to provide Singov cash.
2. Singov is allowed to spend an additional [S$21.6B in FY2022](https://www.mof.gov.sg/policies/reserves/how-do-singaporeans-benefit-from-our-reserves) thank to NIRC. Singov DOESN'T NEED to spend that additional 21.6B. It is just allowed to.
3. This 21.6B cash is actually provided by land sales (10-15B a year) and dividends from Temasek/GIC/MAS + other proceeds we aren't aware of.

Here’s some speculation and observations.

Considering there’s a missing \~10B cashflow needed for NIRC a year (after land sales) and considering TH/GIC/MAS portfolio is about 1T, 10B is about 1%. 1-2% received from dividends (considering ease of liquidity seems reasonable) from T-bills/bonds/etc.

The [recent debate about HDB buying land from the government causing a deficit](https://www.gov.sg/article/factually141022-b) should be tied into this cashflow math. There was a [recent debate in parliament that sale of land assets was a conversion to financial assets](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/budget-debate-singapore-will-not-change-its-approach-to-reserves-because-it-needs-to-think-of-next-generation-lawrence-wong). But the way NIRC is set up, it seems such financial assets are actually ‘covered’ by expected long-term returns from TH/GIC/MAS.

Accounting-wise, there’s really nothing wrong with that. You can call it left pocket to right pocket, but it really doesn’t matter. I also realize a loophole here—Singov doesn’t need to go through the President to assess the hard cash gained from land sales (which should have been locked up in the reserves). They can ‘cover’ the accounting using NIRC expected returns.

Before you raise your pitchforks at PAP, this also brings a doubt to WP’s proposal of raising the NIRC contributions to something like 60-40 to curb the GST increase. Raising to 60% also means about an additional \~4B, which will cover an additional \~2.35% of GST. But then the math doesn’t work out because there’s actually NO cashflow of 4B left anywhere else. The only way to actually have hard cash go to the government is for TH/GIC/MAS to liquidate some of their holdings, and this might be a terrible thing for long-term investing.

**TL;DR**

NIRC, Land sales are a clever accounting method (that seems to skip over the President) + cashflow utilization.

There’s danger of this house of cards falling if at anytime our long-term real returns start to drop (our reserves are filled with ‘expected’ returns that never actually happen).

**Final thoughts**

So is a few billion dollars just going around the table in the name of accounting? MOF allocates money to HDB. HDB buys from Singov land. Singov uses the literal same money to fund itself under the NIRC scheme, and thus allocating to HDB. Accounting-wise, the reserves has some money earmarked thanks to expected returns.

Thoughts? I might have missed out certain points since I'm not trained in fiance or accounting.",NIRC + Land Sales + Reserves + Cashflow

However, I find that there is a lack of voice coming from the opposing parties. From what I can see for myself, the opposition seems to be want to remain neutral and let the incumbent take the brunt of the decision, which is bound to receive hate regardless of which side they lean. I think this is unfair and that the opposition should have clearer stance on the issue, and not hide behind. 

I understand that there are some MPs and individuals who have made rather clear stance like F4isal M4nap who supported the Wear White campaign (anti-Pink Dot), and Chee S00n Juan has been a supporter and attended Pink Dot. But there seems to be an absence of party stance.

singapore," I saw a post a year ago in r/ Singapore about how to seek help for mental health struggles in Singapore and I would like to post an updated issue on this. I found some of the information posted there to be slightly biased and subjective and wanted to post an update, feel free to add on in the comments should there be any errors!

I am currently a social work associate at a social service agency and am clinically diagnosed with depression, having much experience with the mental health system in Singapore. I have experience working with people with mental health struggles and my sources are from personal experience and mostly information shared w me by professionals. I will link my resources when necessary, but recommendations are personal and of no means an advertisement, Also, feel free to pm me should you have questions:)

**Who should seek help**

I wanted to correct the previous post and make it clear that **ANYONE** can and should seek professional help if they feel they need so! You **don't need** to seem serious or your symptoms to be *disruptive*. The severity of the condition should be ascertained by a psychiatrist, just go and seek help should you need it, and don't be discouraged because you think or feel that your symptoms aren't severe or serious enough. Of course, if you are *really* uncertain, you can first talk to a mental health professional or general practitioner and they will be able to advise you. But the main point here is just to reach out if you don't feel good!

**Various professionals**

*Psychiatrists*

Psychiatrists are **medical doctors** who specialize in psychiatry. That means they probably have done their MBBS( bachelor in surgery and medicine) and an MMed (master in medicine: psychiatry). They have the power to diagnose and dispense medicine, something that other professions can't do. However, they normally won't be offering therapy and will be approaching your case from more of a medical/ biological POV. However, they are good avenues for referral and some hospitals do attach a case manager for financial assistance and case management.

It's good to know which level of doctor you are seeing, being a senior consultant, consultant and resident. Senior Consultants are more experienced and would probably take you for your first time at the appointment. Residents are basically junior doctors still working their way up to be a consultant

*Psychologists*

Psychologists or clinical psychologists are professionals that have an academic degree in psychology or clinical psychology and specialize in screening, assessing and administering specific psychological tests or psychotherapy. They often work together with psychiatrists or independently to provide these services depending on their speciality. Some psychologists may be therapists while others may not. Credible psychologists are registered with the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS)

*Therapist/ Counsellors*

Therapist and counsellors are terms that are used interchangeably in Singapore but may have slightly different meanings. Therapists are more specialized in a certain specific therapy while counsellors mostly have a degree in general counselling without too much specialization. However, there can be many variations in the sector and individual counsellors often have preferred therapy approaches. Some therapy modalities can seem to be more effective than others e.g. CBT for depression but all are helpful in mitigating the situation. Some examples of therapy modalities are (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy \[CBT\], eye movement desensitization and reprocessing \[EDMR\], narrative therapy, Choice theory reality therapy, emotions-focused therapy, family therapy etc.). Credible counsellors are registered with the Singapore Association for Counseling (SAC) or have a degree/postgraduate diploma in counselling or therapy

*Social workers*

Most social workers provide services like case management, referrals and group work for individuals struggling with mental health. They **do not** have expertise in treatments as compared to therapists and psychologists unless otherwise accredited. Most social workers in family service centres and community outposts fall under this category. Credible social workers are accredited by the Singapore Association of Social Workers (SASW)

**Various forms of treatment**

I will be classifying treatment for mental illness in two major and more common ways.

*Medical*

Most mental illness need some form of [medication](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications). Most of these treatments include anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, anti-psychotic medication, stimulants etc. Medication is usually slowly taken at a small dosage and adjusted to an effective dosage that allows the individual to function. Medication may include side effects which are dependent on individual medication. Most medications are effective in treating and mitigating mental illness.

*Therapy*

As elaborated earlier, different therapies have different strengths and limitations. There is a wide range of therapy modalities out there which can be useful to your specific mental health condition. However, only **certified and accredited** professionals may administer effective and professional therapy.

**Process of seeking treatment/help**

Should you prefer to see a counsellor or psychologist first, you can make an appointment without the need for a referral from the psychiatrist. Below are some resources

[Insight care corner](https://www.carecorner.org.sg/services/insight/), [Singapore counselling centre](https://scc.sg/e/appointment-booking/), [Counselling and care centre](https://counsel.org.sg/), [The therapy room](https://www.thetherapyroom.com.sg/contact-us/)

*Psychiatrist*

Most will need a referral from a general practitioner or a polyclinic and may take 3-6 months (depending on waiting time) to get you an appointment. This is for public hospitals

For private hospitals, you can just make an appointment without a need for a referral. However, prices are exponentially high( 2- 3x higher than public hospitals, including medication). The upside to private hospitals is that you get immediate care and treatment. I personally got diagnosed and stabilised my conditions before going to a public hospital.

[Mind care Clinic by Prof K](https://www.mindcarespecialists.com/dr-kua-ee-heok/)ua

*Youths*

As a youth myself, I have found it difficult to navigate the mental health system in Singapore due to my age and financial constraints. However, should you know your resources and what to do, it should be generally doable. Should there be no parental consent, financial assistance is available even though medication may be a little tricky. I will suggest a process for youths below 21 to follow based on financial constraints and no parental consent while giving estimated costs.

Consult polyclinic GP for referral ( $20-40) → psychiatrist at a public hospital (60- 100) → proceed to medical social work for financial aid application (medifund) → come back for appointment

As medicine has notable side effects, doctors will request parental knowledge. Financial assistance will sometimes need to contact parents to confirm that they do not have consent. Should this be an issue, you should be able to discuss this with the social worker

It is also helpful to bring a trusted adult or friend to accompany you to treatment. Social support is an integral factor in psychological reintegration and recovery:)",Mental Health Walkthrough Singapore

Singapore's median household income in purchasing power parity dollars (PPP) hit **$110,383 in 2021 (or a nominal $9.5k a month).** The only countries that are higher in PPP dollars income are tax haven states like Lux and Monaco.

At this income, you pay only 7% income tax, that is so low, you pretty much cannot find any other alternatives. 

A median citizen also owns their own houses (or lease it for 99 years). This is also unheard of for median citizens in any other developed cities/countries. The 99-year lease system also benefits the median citizens as it makes it less attractive to the rich, and hence, leveling the playing field. 

Singapore also provide high-quality and cheap pre-university education for all citizens, including median citizen. At $25 per month or less, it is definitely one of the cheapest in the world for what you are receiving. It's also one of the rare developed countries where less than 3% of its population send their kids to private/international schools. This means 97% of people study in public schools. 

Singapore is also cheap. Food, public transport, etc. Considering we have no natural resources, for things to be cheap here is pretty amazing.

opportunity to get some extra money during the holidays and the thought of teaching kids seemed fun cuz ive worked with them before. I did read the contract the day of the interview and it stated that if i were to leave within a few months of being in the company id have to pay $5,000. Which idk why it wasnt alrdy a red flag to me at that time. To add on,
they made me pay what they claim was $200 worth of cpr+aed and swimming coach courses online which to me okay fine. But once I actually got in and
they sent me the links of courses im suppose to join, it added to almost $400! Thats half of what the recruiter told me. But i suck thumb because i was
thinking of the money and the joy of teaching kids.

Basically i js feel like this company is full of sh*t and a scam. The ""training"" they gave was only like 3 lessons conducted in a condo, 1 zoom and 2 attachments. This all claim to be $5,000 by the
recruiter. You cant covince me this is reasonable. I had friends that left this company and and now
theyre trying to charge my friends Which to be fair, stated in the contract that they’re entitled to do so :/

Some things id like to point out also is that they take V long to answer clients. It took them like 3 days to answer a client's queries but when us coach dont
answer them (the company) within 24 hours they try to charge us?

This is just some of the many things. Then again i wont name the company as im afraid of my safety.
But i just want to know is there any way out of this? I made a bad decision signing the contract because i tried seeing the best but instead i feel like im being
scammed and seeing other coaches get scammed.

Pls dont reply any negative comments regarding my decision. I know i should've known better and done more research. I just want out. Pls help.",Help joined a swim company and now cant leave without paying

I've been living here for over 2 years - husband and I both moved here in 2020 from Sydney - bang in the middle of the pandemic - for both of our respective jobs. Found a place (was heaps easier than it is nowadays as no one was really coming into Singapore then), settled in to our home and our jobs, got an adorable pup - proceeded to try to make Singapore home.

My sister and her husband moved here from India about a month ago. And they've started looking for houses which is admittedly SO MUCH MORE difficult now than 2 years ago. They've also been rejected a few times - someone would usually say the landlord gave the house to someone with a better profile - which is totally fair! It's your house/apartment - you give it to whoever you want.

But today, one of the Agents said Landlord wants no idol worship in the apartment. *Not very happy with Indians lah but will give to you as long as no idol worship.*

WHAT THE ACTUAL F? isn't this discrimination, how dare you tell people how to live their lives - is this even legal. Who in the hell do they think they are?

You can make your city as clean and green as you want but nothing changes as long as SCUM like this live in this city.

I've always wondered why Singapore has never felt home. Now i know why - this underlying level of discrimination that has always existed is the reason why. Sometimes obvious, sometimes not,

singapore,"I am asking this here as I’ve searched the internet and all I’m getting is either the ICA/MFA faq pages and an old Reddit post. 

For context:
My partner wants to visit Singapore in December. She needs a visa to visit and I (being a student pass holder) can not apply for a visa for her a local contact.
We have a mutual friend who is a Singaporean citizen who is more than happy to help her apply as a local contact.

We’ve made one submission and we’ve been rejected once. 

I’ve since been thinking about what could have caused the rejection (I know that the ICA does not disclose this kind of information) and here are my thoughts/questions. 

1. How many times can I make an application if the applicant has been rejected?

2. Here is where I think we got rejected on. On our initial submission, we applied for a “multiple entry” visa for a trip no longer than 25 days thinking we can make trips to JB or indo. We are considering just straight up applying for a “double entry” cause we already have tickets to Thailand and indicating this on the form 14a. 

3. If the applicant is a student but is being sponsored by a parent/guardian, do we indicate the annual income of the parent/guardian? 

I am grateful to y’all’s who will take the time to answer and help out and I’m happy to provide more deets where can.",Questions about applying for a visa as a local contact.

singapore,"I was in Singapore for a week. My friends &amp; I loved the cities,food &amp; everything. 

We were quite tired and I said I wanted a swedish massage &amp; we went to Kovan. Please note Im not a saint or something. But I really wanted an authentic swedish massage &amp; my friends wanted more than that ( sort of happy ending) which I didnt want. So i googled and booked a professional look like spa and went over there by 2:00 AM. The receptionist was super friendly and felt really comfortable.

We got into the spa rooms &amp; Chinese cute Masseuse entered into my room. She doesn't know english well But I talked to her and she was nice. Later on I felt like her hands were sliding into my genitals and I was shocked and definitely got a boner. I asked her whats happening and she replied with a top to bottom motion with her hand saying 50 singapore dollars and I felt very bad and rejected. She tried massaging again in the genital area and I said No i dont have cash which made her leave my room &amp; I felt really bad. when i came out of the spa,my friends were so happy that they got what they wanted &amp; roasted all day &amp; night for not taking the chance. I was giggling but deep inside I felt somehing was not right.

&amp;#x200B;

Next night, these people took me again to the same professional looking  Kovan Spa &amp; Coincidentally the same lady was there for me again &amp; upon seeing me she looked angry. I laid down and again talked to her calmly. She again asked me about money &amp; I said  yes I have &amp; she did the same sliding stuff which I stopped &amp; asked her about family.She said she had no choice other than happy ending massages as spa pays her less salary &amp; she badly needed money to take care off her family in China. She was asking me again for money &amp; I said I dont need happy ending but I will give her 50 dollars just to help her out. She was happy &amp; she was surprised why didn't I need it. next moment she giggled and said She liked touching me &amp; my tool. I was like confused &amp; she took the charge &amp; I exploded. I felt really really good but I felt so much of guilt after coming from spa.

She called me from outside &amp; said "" You're a Handsome,good man,none has said to me like this. All people need was handjob and leave. some pays and some wont even pay. She asked me for my insta and told me to stay in touch"".

I felt really bad of their situation, I could see these Masseuse ladies never had a proper washroom or room to rest. They are like machines who are working for money. Even though I said to her I dont need a happy ending , she was afraid whether I wont pay or not. She didnt care about my respect for her. I was being kind to her &amp; she couldn't understand it. Similarly I went to Geylang, i could see women with numbers &amp; having fake smile to impress people. 

I felt bad for such ladies out there. Where is this world going ? Where are emotions ? Have become the victim of money ?

&gt; Similar to all investments, we conducted an extensive due diligence process on FTX, which took approximately 8 months from February to October 2021.

According to the courts document, FTX 
1. Has no proper channel to submit their expense:

 Employees submitted expense reimbursements over chat. A random manager would accept or reject those reimbursements with an EMOJI


2. Related party loans:

Alameda Research (FTX's hedge fund) gave Sam Bankman-Fried a $1 billion personal loan. They also loaned Director of Engineering Nishad Singh $543 million 

3. Very few records were kept. 

Most decisions were made over chat, with the messages automatically deleted after a certain time.

4. No proper corporate governance 

FTX, a company valued at $32 billion, never had board meetings. Neither did most of the subsidiaries.

5. FTX had no cash management system. 

Management had no idea how much cash was on hand at any given time, or even where all their cash was.

6. FTX didn't keep proper records of who they employed. 

Employees and contractors co-mingled throughout the different companies without proper documentation of how they spent their time. Certain employees can't be located: Which could mean that some employees were fake.


And many more other red flags

singapore,"I've been thinking about moving to Singapore for a long time now. And I've been looking into grad school, too, as a non-traditional student, for a career pivot. I got my B.S. quite a while ago. I'm uneasy about trying to find a job because I've had a substantial career break. I heard it was hard for foreigners/ex-pats to get a job, too. I was born in the US, and my parents are from Taiwan. 

How hard is it to get into a decent grad school in Sg from the US? Is it impossible getting into the top ones, unless we have the most excellent credentials? My undergrad is in the top 100 of world unis, but that doen't matter. It is harder or easier for international students to get in? Am I even asking the right questions? 

I'm thinking of various fields, like UX Design, Humanities, and social sciences. And possibly something like MBA. I have lots of interests, so they're all over the place. I want something that's worth it, won't be that agonizing/difficult, and will get me the job I want (in Sg?), and i ncareer that's satifying to me.  

Should I be looking into lower-ranked schools that I have a better chance of getting into? Would they be easier than the top schools?

What about financial aid, scholarhips, etc.? Are they very selective? It would be nice if they were fully funded, maybe with a stipend, or at least cover some of the costs and expenses. 

I hear housing is very expensive in Sg, too, but probably no more than my area, which is probably amongst the highest in the world. 

How is social life, especially for older Asian Americans? Maybe this isn't something anyone can answer. I don't necessarily need to to make much friends, but it would be nice to have a community. 

Is grad school a pretty decent way to enter Singapore? Should I visit first? What should I look out for? Are there any Asia Ameican who felt Sg wasn't for them, and moved out?",Should I move to Singapore from US through grad school?

Well, the issue is, more often than not I have been receiving scam SMSes that says “Your delivery has failed” etc. I am aware that those are scam messages but the timing is just so good and it’s not just once but a few times already.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some tidbits:

&gt;The nascency of the blockchain and digital asset industry presents innumerable opportunities as well as significant risks.

Nascency?  15 years of cryptocurrency and the only uses are speculation, money  laundering, scamming, grifting, and financing criminal activities.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As  an investor-owner seeking sustainable returns over the long term, we   believe that we have to invest in new sectors and emerging, nascent   business models to understand the applications and impact they may have   on the business and financial models of our existing portfolio, or be   drivers for future value in an ever-changing world. This is why we   invest in early stage companies and accept the binary risks associated   with such investments.

Conflating cryptocurrency and related companies with actual technologies and businesses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Similar  to all investments, we conducted an extensive due diligence  process on  FTX, which took approximately 8 months from February to  October 2021.  During this time, we reviewed FTX’s audited financial  statement, which  showed it to be profitable.

Spoiler: FTX's auditors are crypto cheerleaders:  Prager Metis and  Armanino. WTF has heard of them?

They  are small time outfits with poor track records with the Public Company  Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). These two firms in their 2021  reports, did not provide an opinion on the FTX US or FTX Trading  internal controls over accounting and financial reporting. Because there  were none (..)

“Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls"" - FTX liquidator.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We recognise that while our due diligence processes may mitigate certain risks, it is not practicable to eliminate all risks.

Cannot eliminate risk that FTX was a scam, even though they had no proper employee records, headquartered in the Bahamas with an org structure  resembling other scams, had no cash management system, numerous complex  related party transactions, no boards and board meetings, no proper record keeping of decision-making, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Going  Forward (..)  We continue to recognise the potential of blockchain  applications and  decentralised technologies to transform sectors and  create a more  connected world. But recent events have demonstrated what  we have  identified previously – the nascency of the blockchain and  crypto  industry and the innumerable opportunities as well as  significant risks  involved.

Hasn't learned the $275M lesson. Wants to continue dumping public money in crypto and related companies. 

There are two failings here: investing in the crypto space, and performing very poor DD. This is a $275M hole that could have been easily avoided. Given the amount involved, shouldn't the public deserve a proper accounting/investigation into what happened rather than this ill-made statement?

I was just eager to bank with them so I transferred 5000$ and then I checked my TMRW app. The balance was zero. I thought ok, maybe I got too excited. I checked again a few mins later and then after few hours. Still zero balance. 

Checked again next morning and afternoon, nothing!

I was with phone support for 30 mins on 13th nov, only to be told they can’t help and was redirected to use the chat. Chat support told someone will call back. Obviously, no one did. 

Sent an email on 16th and no response.

A friend suggested that it could be the water heater's exhaust pipe (basically when water pressure to high it releases water) and I tried turning off the water supply to one of the water heaters which wasn't replaced when I moved into this house. Tried to appeal the water bill, as I heard water bill can be refunded if water leaks were found, but they need a recipt from a plumber, is there anything I can do?","Water bill jumped x5 times, SP cant refund it."

singapore,"Honestly I think Singtel is ridiculous. It's charge is ridiculous high and not of any significantly better quality. I was on prepaid for years now and recently changed to postpaid just so that I can port out to other telecom without losing this number, to avoid the hassle of informing banks and stuff. If that's why the rest thinks as well. I suggest the hassle is worth it then giving in and using Singtel. They are charing me $300+ for early termination of just merely 1 month of service. I think its quite ridiculous and call their customer service, as I was not aware of this early termination bill and was only told that as long as I paid my bills ( I assumed it was general phone bill). They argued that according to their CCTV and investigation, that was not the case and only agreed to waiver of 50% of the bill. I was sick and tired of singtel and just agreed. Then they decided to call the next day again and say sorry it's not approved and only agreed to waiver of $60. Honestly I find this abit ridiculous. If we agreed on waiving of 50%, why can you just suka suka change the next day? Are you gg to call me on the third day and say sorry cannot waiver off $60 and I need to pay extra or something? Can I request to view this CCTV? How would I know if that's just you or that's the truth if you can just backtrack the next day? Why are you calling me to tell me you can waive off 50% and backtrack the next day? Why are you calling me if it's not approved? Everything you say, you win liao lor.

I'm sure we're all aware that TEL3 recently opened, so I've been thinking about the MRT a lot recently. So, inspired by a similar version I saw on r/brisbane and remembering how much fun we all had when we did the GRC/SMC death ray last year, I would like to propose a MRT death ray!

In the comments, please nominate a station to be zapped, and give a reason for zapping it. You can also participate by upvoting comments for stations you want to see zapped. For the sake of brevity, the 5 stations that are most upvoted will be zapped everyday. Voting will close at about 9.30pm every night, and the next post will be out by about 10pm.

Rules (as taken from the original GRC/SMC death ray):

&gt;1. **Upvotes only, Do not downvote.**  
&gt;  
&gt;2. **Let’s not get too political.**   
&gt;  
&gt;3. **No editing of nominated answers.**

I'm worried because my previous job I held was around 5 years ago and the background company can't verify my duration of employment , salary etc which might backfire. Please help",How far back does employment check goes?
singapore,"So... as title suggests, here we go.  The main dilemma I have is if quitting a job when I am only 2 months in since employment is a good choice or not. For context:

So this is my first job and I work in a lab. I do have an idea of what my career goals are in life, and figured to achieve it, I needed work experience above all else, both in and out of a lab. The problem is, I am not getting any work experience, let alone chance to work done, at all at my company, as the work system and progression is incredibly inefficient and slow. For close to 2 months, I have not done anything remotely productive at all, and with how the system works in place (e.g. everything has to be ""trained"" before you are allowed to do anything), this will probably keep going on for another few months. 

Some chitchat with my fellow colleagues and observing how the gears turn at my workplace have practically confirmed that most of the work experience I want would be at best a year and more away, meaning months of idleness or the odd job here and there (kind of like now). And even if i did somehow not lose my mind from being idle, with the inefficiency the system has at this company, overtime is practically needed everyday as I see in my colleagues or the system itself will punish you for failing to meet demands.

To cap things off, here is where I am asking for opinions to help make or steel my mind. My friends have told me that I would be better off resigning and finding another job to look for what I want, as I am clearly unhappy with the depressing environment as well as outdated and slow-paced nature of my current company. However, my parents are not really pleased with the notion of me quitting my first job so quickly and so early, and that I should ""tough it out"" for at least a year and more. But if this job is not helping with my future career path and goals, am I not just wasting my time for something that might not even help out in my resume? Is it really okay to quit this early, especially given its my first ""real"" job?

TL;DR First job, incredibly slow-paced and inefficient company, not getting to learn or do anything at all, thinking of quitting and seek another (hopefully better) job that can give me what I want but am afraid of quitting early due to parental pressure and stigma.",Should I quit my job?

singapore,"So this did not exactly happen today but a few months back. I saw an elderly on a wheelchair trying to cross a small road by himself. He seemed feeble and lacked the arm strength to push the wheels of his wheelchair forward and instead relied on his feet to move himself ahead. The street was near an area with shophouses on the ground level of HDB flats and there was quite a few unloading vehicles nearby. I offered to help him with my basic Hokkien communication skills and he told me he needed help back to the foot of his apartment block. When we have arrived at the destination I offered him to help him back to his apartment but he declined.

So here's the part that I F'ed up. My muscle memory kicked in and left the wheelchair brakes in the locked state. I have a grandma to take care of and I usually do this on unleveled ground to prevent accidents from happening. The place where I left the elderly man was on an inclined elevated ground (for water draining purposes I presume). It is only hours after that I realised what hap transpired. I went back to the location to check up on him but he was not there. I hope that some other kind person had helped him. IRRC his urine bag attached to his wheelchair was still quite empty, but I can imagine the ordeal he went through.

Note: I am a ditz and I had no malicious intent when doing so. I'm the kind of person that may ask an arm amputee: ""Do you need a HAND?"" *facepalm*",TIFU by helping an elderly

I understand that attacking somebody with a knife would fall under the charge of rioting with deadly weapon and if the victim is badly injured / on the brink of death it would be with the charge of grevious hurt. Then attacking someone with your barehands counts as just rioting.

My question would be, what if i were to whack someone with a cane repeatedly to teach him a lesson in public. in a wooden cane which chinese parents beat their children with but it’ll be quite thick. I dont think it’ll be charged under deadly weapons or rioting right? What would my charge be if i were to be hauled to court?

There are countless of anti-scam campaigns, but there will always be stupid and gullible people (somehow the kindest people I know aren't the brightest). Nonetheless, the law enforcement has to do their job and start making arrests instead lip service.

No. No I can't. I'll still come back to being lonely depressed and suicidal. I just have to keep finding another way to distract myself. And frankly I'm becoming tired of finding things to do.

singapore,"Hi everyone, i'm writing this post to sincerely request every football loving Singaporean to NOT SUBSCRIBE to the Qatar WORLD CUP matches on Starhub &amp; Singtel. I make this request for the following reasons:

1. The inhumane treatment of migrant workers who built the infrastructure for the WC

* Thousands have died building infrastructure for the world cup with many others suffering long term conditions as a result of working in searing heat {[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022); [https://time.com/6227277/qatar-extreme-heat-world-cup-2022/](https://time.com/6227277/qatar-extreme-heat-world-cup-2022/))
* Migrant workers have been forced from their homes and evicted without warning ([https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/exclusive-thousands-workers-evicted-qatars-capital-ahead-world-cup-2022-10-28/](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/exclusive-thousands-workers-evicted-qatars-capital-ahead-world-cup-2022-10-28/))
* Migrant workers' contracts have not been fulfilled, wages not paid and many have been repatriated to their home countries mired in debt ([https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/22/migrant-workers-in-qatar-left-in-debt-after-being-ordered-home-before-world-cup-starts](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/22/migrant-workers-in-qatar-left-in-debt-after-being-ordered-home-before-world-cup-starts))
* Migrant workers have been forced to live in horrible conditions ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60867042](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60867042))

2. The awarding of the World Cup to Qatar is surrounded by huge allegations of corruption involving FIFA officials, media executives etc. The (then) President of FIFA has just come out and said that it was a ""mistake"" to award Qatar the World cup ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/soccer/qatar-and-russia-bribery-world-cup-fifa.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/soccer/qatar-and-russia-bribery-world-cup-fifa.html); [https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/qatar-is-mistake-says-former-fifa-president-sepp-blatter-2022-11-08/](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/qatar-is-mistake-says-former-fifa-president-sepp-blatter-2022-11-08/)).

3. Qatar have horrible laws criminalising same-sex relationships, with even the possibility of the death penalty for muslims ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT\_rights\_in\_Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Qatar))

&amp;#x200B;

For these 3 stated reasons, I sincerely believe that this World Cup goes against everything we as a country believe in. Yes, we aren't the best when it comes to treatment of migrant workers. However, we do not treat them nearly as badly as the Qatar government and their associated companies have. I believe it is horrible to cheer on teams in stadiums built on the blood of these people. Further, we as a nation abhor corruption. The process of awarding of this world cup to Qatar was corrupt and goes against one of the fundamental values of our country. Next, we have recently abolished  section 377A and while we will still move to recognised marriages as only between man and women, Qatar's laws on homosexuality border on savagery. This is also something, we as a nation have moved on from and is clearly not within our values. 

I love football with all my heart, but to watch this World Cup will be to endorse and approve of Qatar's abhorrent behaviour in hosting this tournament. I believe, if at least a significant minority of us boycott the World Cup and show that by not subscribing to the channels, out little red dot can send a message that this shit just isn't right. 

Thank you for reading this long post.

Also, how many of you guys walked up and eventually gotten the contact leading to dates?

In my limited experience (clubs aside), I've gotten a few numbers off the street and on public transport, but only achieving very low conversion (to dates/partner) rate.

Based on an avg 7,000 monthly household income, it takes **3 years** to finish paying for the mortgage.


88% of Singaporeans can afford to buy their own homes, according to Singstat data. In the majority of cases, HDB flatowners don't even need to pay cash on top of their CPF payments. 

But, but what about the Redditors who say they can't afford their BTOs? They can, if they get a job. 

Starting graduate salaries are 3,500 a month. In a dual income household, that's already the average of 7,000 a month. This is data from the GES survey.

I suspect they are nakedly lobbying for prices of BTOs to come down, so they can get a flat on SALE vs. their real incomes.

Was wondering if Singapore Hospitals will charge a lower rate for medication?  Or even prescribe medications in the basis of 2-3 months at a time?  


What are your costs of ADHD medication above?  Do singapore hospitals give more supply say 2-3 months at a time?  


How has your medication needs change over the years for ADHD?",ADHD Consultation &amp; Medication Cost

singapore,"Hi there! I’m currently living in Japan with my partner so I’m still getting all the details from my mum/family at the moment. 

My mums cat is a fold/ragdoll mix. We always send the cat to a groomer. We send the cat at 12-2pm and pick him up at 6-8pm. Yesterday, my mum sent him as I am currently overseas. When she got him back, she brought him home but his breathing and stress levels seemed really high. Brought him to the emergency vet, but he was not breathing already. Vet attempted to resuscitate him but failed. 

My mum is currently an emotional wreck and she called the groomer but the groomer scolded her and said why blame us. I’m not sure how to proceed, or even what to do at this point with the groomer. We have always had an issue with this groomer in terms of time, they do a good job with the grooming but the time they take is long compared to the quoted time. Anyone who have any similar experience please do chime in. 

I have never heard my mum cry like that before and it was very hard to talk to her as I myself am not very good with these things.",Mum sent our cat to a local groomer. After she picked him up he seems to have elevated stress levels and ultimately passed away at the emergency vet later on the same day.

TAIPEI and SINGAPORE: It was a building with doors and windows blocked by curtains. Sealed off from the outside world, it bore the features of a typical scam call centre.

During stakeouts, the police saw a man going in and out and returning with almost 20 bento boxes at a time.

When more than 10 people are “actively scamming” in a call centre, “you know they aren’t just cheating tens of thousands” of dollars, said Tai Ming-Yu, a detective in Taiwan’s Miaoli County police bureau. “They’re scamming hundreds of thousands, even … millions of dollars.”

What was unusual, however, was seeing “this many scammers at once” in the mountainous county, he added.","NEWS: ‘Suddenly there’s an expensive car’: In Taiwan, how scammers targeting Singapore were caught"

- not pursuing further studies because they were married and had a home to finance. 

- finding out that they married the wrong person.

I am sure we all know of someone who intentionally choose to wait till uni to apply PR/citizenship avoid NS obligations, *not to mention those who marry a local to bto etc.* They have no interest in Singapore other than the benefits they can reap here.

I am very welcoming to foreigners. Nevertheless, the sole reason NS exist is to protect us from Msia. Hence, shouldn't it be a criteria for Msia who wish to call SG their home and obtain citizenship, they have to go through the 2 years rite of passage.

More particularly, to quote him, those 'pinafores and/or 'sexy' uniforms' from all girls schools or just co-ed in general. I think you guys might know what I mean? Is it normal or a red flag?

Personally, the hotel was okay at best. The pool is a wow factor maybe the first time, and then you figured out how an infinity pool works and the view, you get is the same as those on the viewing deck. And let's not forget, you ain't paying for the room, but the pool.

But, the customer service is just utter shit. Takes forever to get a room at the hotel, and now, they start to charge for previously free services (folding bed cost 100 bucks a night) ffs. And no complimentary breakfast. Oh and even if you stay, you gotta pay for a parking coupon.

Plus, the pool is overcrowded as fuck. Its not like the pictures people expect, tons of japanese, russians, and rich chinese tourists who just like to take selfies and block the whole area. Not forgetting, you are now only allowed 2 keycards up the pool, down from 4 previously. And they are the same keycards as the hotel room, so if you got a family of four, good luck!

The rooms aren't too impressive either, they look pretty average for something you paid so much money for. 

For the same price, you can stay at a hotel in orchard or elsewhere, get a bigger room and better service than the marina bay sands. Its just sad that they know they can screw customers, and yet people will still come cause infinity pool!","Folks who had stay before in Marina Bay Sands hotel, what do you think about it?"

1. Passengers would proceed through the metal detectors first, proceeded by going to staff who are stationed near metal chairs where you'll be given a Health Questionnaire and direct you to the queue, depending on your deck number. 
2. Usually, passengers in decks 2, 3, 7 &amp; 9 will be queuing up by the left side of the building (CM01) where as decks 4, 6, 8 &amp; 10 will be queuing up by the right side of the building (CM02). 
**Note: If you've applied for a Junior Suite, do not expect us to send you to the ""Suite"" queue because here, suites refer to the Family Suites.**
3. Once you've queued up, there will be people who will ask for your ""Set Sail Pass"", if you do not have one, don't worry, show them any of your cruise documents that shows your deck number. If you're priority, you HAVE to show them your Set Sail Pass as that is the ONLY document that shows your loyalty rank (Gold, Platinum, Emerald, Diamond, Diamond Plus, Pinnacle Club and Suites). 
4. Once you're at the front of the queue, there will be staff who will give you a ""Boarding Card"" and direct you to an available counter. Whatever you do, do not, I repeat, DO NOT lose it. It's essential.
5. Once you've checked in, there will be staff members who will direct you to the Mezzanine level, where you will be held until boarding time starts.
**Note: boarding starts TENTATIVELY at 12pm, so take it with a grain of salt when your travel agent says that boarding time starts at 12pm. If you're hungry, there are vending machines on the 2nd floor. If you're wondering about anything ship related, such as is there complimentary internet access on board, chances are we do not know. We're Ground Handlers, we're not part of the ship crew. You could ask Guest Relations on Deck 5 once you're on board though.**
6. This is where your Boarding Card comes in effect. In your Boarding Card, there will either be ""Group N (where N is an integer)"" or a colour written on it. This dictates your boarding group. Instead of boarding based on decks, you'll board based on your boarding group. 
 * The order are as follows:  Numbered Groups starting from 1 to 10 followed by Coloured Groups starting from Red, Pink, Yellow and so on. 
7. Once your boarding group has been called, proceed down the escalator or elevator and proceed to immigration, depending on the ship, immigration could either be A (CM01 side) or B (CM02). Staff will be there to direct you there. 
**Note: Get your Passport and Sea Pass card ready.**
8. Once you've cleared customs, proceed to the gangway. Again, staff would be there to direct you. You'll be stopped along the way for staff members to collect your passports. Don't worry, you'll get it back when you're disembarking. 
9. Get on board. 

2) Tips &amp; FAQs.

* Want to board earlier? Arrive at the Cruise Centre earlier. 
* Remove your sunglasses and hats until you get into your stateroom as staff manning the check-in counters will have to take a photo of you using their webcam for verification purposes. Same goes when you're on board.
* Once you get your Health Questionnaire, you DO NOT have to fill it up on the spot. You can either fill it up on the way to the queue or when a Check-In Agent is attending to you.
* Make sure you do not have any food when you go though the metal detectors. Security Staff will confiscate it, period. 
* Waiting for someone after you've checked in? Please do not wait near the exit line. Instead, take a seat near-by and wait. 
* Smoking Area's in the parking lot outside the building.
* This have been asked very frequently: The system is so to not make immigration a total Charlie Foxtrot and also for organization purposes. 
* (I thank /u/luacs1998 for pointing this out) Whatever you do, **DO NOT LOSE THE SEA PASS.** That also serves as your ID when you disembark from the ship during your cruise for excursions. 

**Any queries? Feel free to ask, though I may not be able to answer some of the questions. If I can't, I'm sorry.**


EDIT One: [This](http://imgur.com/a/i9dxZ) is a SetSail Pass.

EDIT Two: [These](http://imgur.com/a/IW6gF) are Sea Passes that you'll receive once you've completed check-in.

The same thing actually happened to me last year(Which is also why I left the company and retail line of work), I was suppose to be on annual high key ICT last year during Oct that starts on Mon and ends on the following week Friday, but to my surprise, my Thai manager doesn't know how to plot shift for Locals and she was told by the Area Manager to plot exactly the same way, in other words, right after my 11 days of High key ICT, I was expected to work another 2 days throughout the weekend without any rest.

It also emphasized a very beaucratic and rational style of governance, with heavy emphasis on performance targets (remind you of KPIs?), centralized administrative control, adherence to objective rules and regulations, etc. In short, it sounds very similar to modern day Singapore and LKY's style of governance, except that the punishments, policies, etc are adapted to the relatively more humane standards of modern times and to the unique geopolitical circumstances of Singapore including the reality of multiple races and small size etc. What are your thoughts on this?",Differences between the Singapore style of governance and Legalism (ancient Chinese philosophy)?

So I tried reasoning and he calmly told me I could check it myself and he didn't cheat my money. I looked at the transparent cover and saw the mass of small coins inside, and I don't blame him. Why? Because of how the thing was made, it's a little hard to count coins when they are a mess at the bottom.  Not wanting to create anymore unnecessary fuss among the crowd, I just threw in my 2 dollar note and got on with it. I paid a dollar and a half extra for my journey. 

Has this happened to any of you? What do you think could be done to improve this?

At least have the decency to warn users, but no, they won't risk rousing the ire of angry users so just fuck them, let them use more data and pay later.

Another thing that SMRT started - guilt tripping. You're a disgrace for even trying to throw your workers in our face, insinuating that WE are making their lives difficult. It's your company, your profits; take some fucking responsibility and stop using rank and file workers as shields.

singapore,,How come we don't have fast food restaurants with Mexican food?
singapore,"I made a black Friday US purchase last saturday, 26-Nov, during their black Friday promotion. Used their buyforme service, and my order was placed when I checked the next day.

Fast forward to thursday, I checked my Ezbuy account the the order status did not change, still showed as ""order placed"" only. Contacted their customer service to ask about the status of my order, was told that they need time to check and their system could not automatically capture US retailer websites. Fine, so I waited.

Today, 7 days after I placed my order, I was informed by Ezbuy that the merchant cancelled my order, no further explanation. Asked if whether I want to wait another 5days for them to re-order it again.

By now, the item I wanted to buy was no longer discounted (ended on 30-nov), and my item was still in stock. I have purchased from this US merchant before over the past few years (self-purchase followed by shipping via comGateway) and I know it to be reputable, never had any problems. Always shipped the items within 2 days, tops.

So now thanks to Ezbuy, I missed out on the sale price of the item that I have been eyeing for 3 months, with no expectations that Ezbuy will honour the sales price ($30USD difference). In fact I doubt if they even placed the order in the first place. 

Contacted them again to either honour the price and reorder, or refund me the money. Knowing how efficient they are, will probably need to wait another 2-3, days before getting a response.

I still have 3 packages bought during 11/11 stuck in their China warehouse, 1 item enroute via air shipment from China for  2weeks and still haven't reached sg (plane missing isit?), plus 2 items they said they lost when I showed up to collect it. It's the 9th day now since their customer service said they will investigate, and till now no update at all.

Seriously regret falling into their promotion trap, would definitely not recommend to anyone. They may be the cheapest option out there, but it's becoming very obvious to me why they are so cheap. Cos they are simply, utter crap.

Anyone else would like to share their experience with Ezbuy?

Update 5-Dec:
Just received a reply from Ezbuy saying the reason the order was cancelled by the merchant was because they are not based in US, which is total nonsense. I -have- purchased from them before directly in the past and they are based in Wisconsin.

Now to wait and see how long it takes for them to refund me my money. Great job, Ezbuy.",Bad Ezbuy Black Friday experience

Mainly looking at better reliability that does not fail on a fucking Saturday or during the damn school holidays.. Great if it is cheaper too.

I think plans above 100Mbps that don't compromise cost efficiency are also great, since you know there's obviously some downloading of games, movies etc especially during holidays.

singapore,"Hey guys, 
I've been offered a job in Singapore, and I'm going to take the plunge and move out from Dubai. I've been to SG about 5 times in the last two years so I'm comfortable with navigating my way around the city, however I know it's going to be vastly different when I live there. What I'd like some insight on (besides everything I've read in the sidebar) is the following:

- Are there any good bank/credit card comparison sites where I can weigh the pros and cons of certain bank accounts? btw, not looking for international remittances/USD accounts if that makes any difference.
- Are there any unspoken rules when it comes to work etiquette that you think don't exist elsewhere?
- I'm not coming in on a fancy expat relocation package, so is there anything I should be on the lookout for? I'll be getting an EP. 
- If I move, I'll bring clothes, my personal electronics, some books, etc. Anything else other newcomers don't consider bringing but wish they had?
- Also, I have stupidly bright rainbow-coloured hair. It's been kind of okayed by the guys I'll be working with (by ""kind of okayed"", I mean I went in for a series of interviews with them and they didn't object). My job will have some client-facing time, so will this raise eyebrows in a corporate environment? Are there good hair salons you'd recommend that know how to work with crazy colours, especially with people who have naturally dark hair?
- I'm not looking to come to Singapore, live for a few years, and then leave. I do seriously see myself settling down there for several reasons. Do you have any tips that can help me assimilate? I don't want to live in a little cushy expat bubble and only hang out with people who have the same background as I because that defeats the purpose of moving anywhere, tbh. 

You've probably read dozens of these posts already from potential newcomers, so I'd appreciate you guys taking the time to help another newcomer with whatever little information you can give me. Thanks! :)

I went down to A.Lab service centre on the 28th of November and got a new replacement set. The staff there called Derek asked me if I want to activate the iPhone myself or he'll help me to do it. I let him do it, checked the phone for scratches and left. Note that I was using the LG V20 backup phone still and did not notice the activation lock at all.

 Next day, when I wanted to use the phone I realised there's an icloud account logged in with find my iPhone on, I found it weird so I restarted the phone and now there's a passcode. I felt that something is not right so I went down to A.Lab and they declined about everything, pushing the responsibilities. I have the original receipt from Singtel + the customer service report from A.Lab clearly indicating that I've exchanged my old iPhone 7 for this new iPhone 7 that has an activation lock on it. A.Lab contacted Apple for me and sent all the documents to them. They assured me that it has been approved and I'll be receiving an email to deactivate it. 

To my horror, next day I received an rejection email from Apple next day. From then on, A.Lab have been very unresponsive to my enquiries and I've been in touch with a senior advisor from Apple to help me to resolve this but he needs A.Lab to cooperate. He even asked me if there are consumer laws in Singapore. I find it unacceptable that A.Lab is pushing all the responsibilities to the customer and Apple when I clearly got the replacement phone from them. 

Documents I have:

I have the tax invoice from singtel

Summary of the saga from EDMW:

*Just a summary of the Xedo saga.*

*Back then Xedo said they no choice becoz the Japanese company ask them to catch.*

*People who went down signed an agreement they downloaded illegally and agreed to paid them compensation.*

*Our ISPs Sinktel n Starfug never protect us. Only Pacific net fight to the end and I think they managed to protect the downloaders. Those ntu nus downloaders also bo tai ji because school protect them.*

*Later 1 of bosses start with s de caught laughing at the downloaders on an online forum. Something about double 6ing people.*

*Later this sh1t blow until very big. I think some lawyer say they only distro no right to fine ppl coz they not copyright holder. N some japanese anime company oso say never ask them 2 catch. They ownself kay kiang 1. Later lawyer say can ignore their letter. They no way to enforce unless u sign the agreement so is like blackmail.*

*Later the boss family kena csi out. Dunno got kena harrass or not.*

*Then some employee say their product subtitle is the boss ask them buy china sub then translate 2 eng de. Tats y kns.*

*After all the crap. They disappear le. Their product all never print their brand big big le. They more of behind the scene organise anime stuff.*

*Never 4get that.*",Have Singaporeans forgive / forgotten about the Odex Saga back in 2007?

I spent two months in Singapore five years ago, and spent two months again in Singapore this year to sort out everything pertaining to citizenship.

In May 2017, I will have to leave America and go back to Singapore to serve NS. As time goes on, I'm becoming increasingly worried about how people will treat me in terms of my race and ethnicity. I'm hoping someone here will either alleviate or validate my fears, so that I'll know what to expect.

I have an American accent, I don't speak any Asian languages, and I have an American surname. I've been told I look Asian, but I'm not entirely sure what ethnicity I look like. My mother is Malay, however. Taking these qualities into mind, how can I expect to be treated? Specifically, I'm interested in whether it will it be easier or more difficult for me to make friends, and whether or not I'll have a chance in the dating scene.

Thanks for taking a look at my post, reader. If you have any advice for getting through NS or just advice on preparing for it, I'd greatly appreciate that too.

singapore,"Urgently looking for a new home for the two black cats living in my house, or at least advice on what else can be done. I was going to keep posting to reddit for help as one of the last resorts and given circumstances, this is the time for last resorts.


Ok so a bit of back story: both cats came from my army camp. Two to four years old, as estimated by the vet, the female is named Bast and the male Three. The former is incredibly active and curious, has grown somewhat fat, can get extremely affectionate and loves belly rubs; the latter is more shy and quiet, can sit somewhere for hours on end so long as it's dark and comfortable and follows Bast around everywhere like a second shadow.

I used to feed them and another cat while they lived there; and later these two got into trouble for having a tendency to sneak into places like the roof, the officers' mess and the service dog kennels, RSM was contemplating calling AVA, I quickly took them home the same weekend to stay. That was three months ago.

My parents were okay with it intially, but they were expecting small kittens and not the two miniature black panthers so they were a bit taken aback when they saw them for the first time. The problem was my dad and my brother had (and still have) a fear of cats so they were relegated to stay out of the rooms and only have a small space to roam.

The bigger problem is that my mum, who became their main caretaker and does adore the two of them a lot, developed a skin allergy in the form of rashes that have become increasingly unbearable. Despite her being the one to convince the rest of the family to keep them for longer she's also been pushing me to find a new home for them, reasoning that we've cared for them long enough and given them a good life but they would be better off with a family that can let them roam around properly.

I don't want to just hand them over to a shelter or SPCA because I really do love these two a lot and feel responsible for them at the very least till then. I want to make sure they go to someone I can be assured will take care of them. I’ve asked friends, reached out to my church, to cat adoption and welfare pages on Facebook and I know my mum has too with about little to no success thus far. Unfortunately she’s at the end of her tether already with the unbearable itchiness from the allergy as well as tired from constantly taking care of them, so she’s pretty much at her final straw and delivering ultimatums. 

Even if I can’t find them a new home soon, like in the next 24 hours she wants me to find somewhere to put them temporarily until we can find new owners. Are there any trustworthy places I can go to, or other options I can take, or even anybody willing to take these two in for a while around here? 

Thank you very much in advance, sorry if a lot of this is rambling because I’m typing this while exhausted and a bit upset.",Home needed for two cats

singapore,"My company has appointed a well known company as the third party agent which does all the work related to EP application, renewal, cancellation etc. A year back a colleague applied for a LTVP for his parents. While the MOM fee is about 30$ for the application the third party agent (TPA) charged about 1500$ each for his parents to process the application. Worse still when he enquires about cancelling the LTVP recently he has been told by the TPA that they will charge about 500$ for submitting the application online. Now my questions are:
1. While my company has appointed the TPA to facilitate the MOM process and reducing HR headcount, is it fair to charge so much fee for these services from employees who have no other choice?
2. While MOM has kept fee so low and provided an online facility (just a few clicks), doesn't it defeat the whole purpose when an agent milks this opportunity? Are there any guidelines on how much TPA's can charge?

In my view this arrangement takes back the MOM efficiency to  those in counties like India, Thailand, Vietnam where private agents rule the roost. It's very unfortunate. I was surprised that my colleague thought this fee was actually being paid to MoM and the TPA only took a small part as commission. I'm not sure if I can raise this with MOM or whether I should ask my company.

You will not know how to dress, in the mandatory bulky black robes, or how to put your hair up as the other girls do. You will not know how to walk, high heels unsteady on ancient cobblestones. You will not know how to talk, of their celebrities, their politics, their favorite operas, their units of measurement, their terms of endearment.

In class, in Front Court just off the famous Wren Chapel, you will learn that you do not know Latin. Claudia, from Poland, knows Latin. She also knows Polish, but hates speaking it with the young Polish woman who cleans her rooms. We’re in England now, she says.

Julie, from Ireland, speaks with a perfect Standard English accent. So do Jonah from Manchester and Dr Davis, from Wales. So do Emma, from Oslo; and Adrian, from Belgrade; and Patrick, from Berlin. So do you. Joshua, also from Singapore, speaks with a thick Singaporean accent. Nobody speaks to him, because nobody understands him, except you.

You never learn Latin, but you learn to fake it well enough to give the prayer before the Fellows in the dining hall. It’s an honor, you’re told. You shape the vowels carefully with your tongue: Oculi omnium in te sperant. The eyes of all look upon thee.

You study versification. Versification is the study of form in poetry. You learn that we all speak in iambs, like the Greeks. You write poetry, and learn the proper names for what you do: this is enjambement, this is anaphora, that isisocolon. You learn to paint with the textures that make up Britain: limestone, pipesmoke, lambswool, tweed; reckon, rubbish, brilliant, dodgy, quid.

At the International Students Gathering you will be told that you are interesting. You are foreign, you are a learning experience for others, you are exotic. People will ask where you come from. Singapore. Oh! they say – chewing gum is illegal there, isn’t it, and they cane people for vandalism. Don’t they also cut off the hands of thieves? No, you say. Oh, they say. Are you certain?

Every day you will walk by King’s Chapel and every day be astounded by the sublime. There is something sacred, it seems, in the smooth stone and stained glass, in the altitudinous arches against the northern sky. Even the sky looks different here – a truer sky blue. The plants are a different green, milder than the ferns of the humid tropics, and more elegant. The trees are deciduous, quadrilingual.

In the chapel you will hear Allegri’s Miserere and in the sharp highs and tumbling-bell cascades of gowned choir-boys come to know a different God than the one you met with guitar music in your old Sunday School. You will read Milton, and see His beauty. You will read Eliot, and see His wisdom.

You will travel. You go to Athens, and you go to Rome. You go to Paris, London, Vienna, old cities rich with marble and history. You see the rock where St Paul preached, the hall where Mozart played, the house Jane Austen lived in. You see the beds of heroes, the halls of two hundred kings and queens.  You see places that matter. Nothing in your country is more than two hundred years old.

Your Marxist friend is repulsed by the splendor of Vatican City. You somewhat agree, but still you buy an overpriced rosary from the Vatican gift shop. Your people don’t pray with rosaries, so you don’t know what to do with it. Still, it is a valuable thing – made of plastic, to be sure, but stamped with the official insignia. The keys to the kingdom.

You go to the opera. You go to museums. You learn the names of the masters, you learn their styles – the long slim forms of Botticelli, the bright grace of Raphael, the abs on the Michelangelo, the curves on the Titians – pink cheeks and white faces. You see hall upon hall of kouroi, men in the proportions of gods, with smooth blank eyes. You see beauty in the rich thickness of oil paints, in the huge splendid canvases, the gold frames, the high ceilings. You are happy and gratified and impressed. No one from your country ever made such things. You do not think to ask why.

Your friends ask you about visiting Singapore. What’s there to see there? they ask. We don’t have much culture, you say.

You direct a play. You would have liked to act instead, but there are no Chinese women in Chekhov’s Russia. There are no Chinese in Ibsen’s Norway.  There are no Chinese in the Germany of Carl Jung or in Chicago in the 1950s. There are no Brits either, but that doesn’t seem to matter.  In three years of theatre you will see two black faces on stage. One is Othello. The other is a maid.

You see The Mikado by Gilbert and Sullivan. We are gentlemen of Japan… / On many a screen and fan We figure in lively paint / Our attitude’s queer and quaint / You’re wrong if you think it ain’t! The emperor likes decapitation. The heroine’s name is Yum-Yum. It is a comedy. You laugh.

You study Shakespeare. You study tragedy. Ancient tragedy is the fall of a great man due to an unfortunate fault. Modern tragedy is the confrontation of a brave man with his own existential terror.  Other things are tragic, but you don’t hear too much about them. You meet Willy Loman, Primo Levi, Nora Helmer, but it’s hard to pay attention. Sophocles speaks too loudly. Oedipus is king.

You study moral philosophy: Aristotle, Cicero, Locke, and Kant. You learn to read them with blinkers on, mining them for the things that matter. You learn to write the way they do – assertive, arrogant, to-the-point. Men do better in exams, you are told, because they write this way. You must be confident. You must write like a man.

You study the Romantics. You learn what nature looks like: white cliffs, high moors, rolling hills, spring air, green meadows; here and there a Roman ruin, here and there a shepherdess. What’s there to see in Singapore? your friends ask. We don’t have much nature, you say.

You go bird-watching. There are several thousand bird species in the UK alone – robins, garnets, ravens, terns. You learn the names of trees and flowers – lilacs, magnolia, primrose, rosemary for remembrance, hyacinth for constancy, poppies, which mark the War Dead.It seems these flowers have a history that your flowers don’t. Poets write about them; they have meanings in books, and value in the flower shops.

No one writes about the ixoras that grew in your old neighborhood – dense stubby shrubs with blooms no bigger than a wink, but beloved for the single drop of nectar you could suck from the stems. Or about the hibiscuses, brilliant and brash with their long dangling stamens; or the bouganvilla, common, roadside-dusty, with their paper-thin petals. Or angsanas, with their space-ship seeds. Rain trees like vine-strewn umbrellas. Franjipanis. Pong-pongs.

Three short years later you will stand in a queue; neat rows of black robes and mostly white faces. When your turn comes you will kneel at the feet of an old man in a five-hundred-year-old chair. He says something in Latin you won’t care what it means. He gives you a scroll. You smile. You graduate.

*

All this is not a warning or a complaint about how unfair life will be for you. After all, you will not be unhappy; or if you are, you will not really notice. No one will be cruel to you, no one will be unfriendly, and you will learn many things. You will enjoy yourself, more or less; and you will make friends, acquire ‘social polish’, a confidence in speaking, the tools to make yourself heard.

These are all good things. They are the things that you went to Britain to acquire. But I am writing to you to make you see what you will be at pains not to see: that as you acquire them, there will also be parts of you that are lost. And I am writing to tell you that your gains are not innocent – that they come with the baggage of coloniality.

You will deny this at first, because you and your country are modern and free, and you will see your choice of university as precisely the expression of that freedom and ability. To think otherwise will seem almost absurd: you are at Cambridge; how could you possibly be oppressed?

But coloniality didn’t end in 1963, when the British let your country go. It is not just the business of unfortunate Third Worlders in distant lands, still floudering in corruption and poverty because they lacked the vision and the statecraft of a Lee Kuan Yew.

Coloniality continues, in fact, whenever bright young men and women from all over the world decide to cap off their educations by going on pilgrimage to pinnacles of Western civilization; when they dedicate themselves to the Western canon and walk in the shadows of gothic cathedrals and imperial facades, and learn that this is the good life.

It continues whenever anyone anywhere in the world walks down a street and sees a billboard on the modern cathedral that is a shopping mall, and sees in that conjunction of power, wealth, and beauty an image of desire. In other words, it happens these days not by the strength of arms or the power of states, but by the captivation of the eyes, the training of the taste, by unwritten rules of thumb – that we all learn everywhere, without even knowing it. Coloniality is far from over: it is all over. It is perhaps the most powerful set of forces in the modern world.

That may sound strange to you, because the power of Cambridge – of Europe itself – seems today to lie in the richness of its history. But to be truly modern is precisely to have a rich and legitimate history that one can master, draw from, and transcend. It is to have a history that is valuable in the present, transactable as social capital in an economy of competitive relations; in clear contrast to other, ‘anthropological’ histories – ‘African’, ‘Oriental’ – that are outdated, unusable, primitive. Besides, modernity comes in many guises: in skyscrapers and banks, to be sure, but also in fish knives, in cathedrals, in the knowledge of opera, in savoir faire.

But modernity is not truly in the skyscraper or the bank or even the savoir faire. It is in the movement of a dangerous gift, transmitted from the West to the rest. Modernity says: we have the good, and we will give – or teach, or sell – it to you. Modernity is salvation through this gift from your prior self. It is Sir Stamford Raffles of the East India Company turning Temasek, the fishing village, into Singapore, the trade hub and aspiring metropolis. It is the magnificent edifice of Cambridge University turning Melissa, the girl who wore cheap pajamas sewn by her grandma to bed, into Melissa, the cosmopolitan, who graduated in a Hepburn dress and a fur hood.

Modernity is someone saying to you: look, we have made you better. And you believing it.

But why do you believe it? Why will your ignorance of the fish knife cut so deep? Why will your love of opera and your love of ixora be respectively crucial and inconsequential for your sense of sophistication and self-worth? It makes little logical sense, but coloniality doesn’t work that way.As you will learn, it works by the smallest and the largest things: from chit-chat to cathedrals. Another way of putting this is that the West has colonized not only knowledge, but aesthesis – every kind of sensing, believing, feeling.

What can you do, then? Coloniality cannot be un-done, any more than you can un-read Chaucer or un-see Caravaggio, and it is undeniable that these things have broadened your mind.

But the question is not how to retreat or how to prune yourself back to some pristine, native state. In fact, it is the opposite: how to recognize the narrowness of this so-called broadened mind – to realize that Europe is not the universe – and to take your sensing and knowing beyond those dominant ideas of the true, the good, and the beautiful. To move towards a pluri-verse that gives dignity to both the girl in the pajamas and the one in the little black dress – and yet to do so in a way that, unlike Western liberalism, is not naïve about either the ‘equality’ of the two, or about how we got from the one to the other.

This means that it is not enough to simply read Confucious alongside Aristotle, or to turn from Uffizi to the Asian Civilizations Museum. That is part of it, certainly, but it doesn’t go far enough. In fact, merely claiming that ‘our’ art or philosophy is as beautiful or good as their Western counterparts only disguises the problem: it hides the issue of why we are in the position of having to make that claim in the first place (the question of coloniality), and it begs the question of what we mean by ‘good’, or ‘beautiful’, or even by ‘art’ or ‘philosophy’ (the question of imperial aesthetics).

The movement known as ‘decolonial aesthetics’ is aimed at asking exactly those two questions. It is the study of how Western aesthetic categories like ‘beauty’ or ‘representation’ came to dominate all discussion of art and its value, and of how exactly those categories were are used – in everyone from Kant to Conrad – to organise and control the way we think of ourselves and others: as white or black, high or low, rich or poor, strong or weak, good or evil.

And decolonial art (or literature, architecture, and so on) is art that enacts these critiques by exposing coloniality and its injustices and contradictions, often using juxtaposition, parody, irony, or simple disobedience towards the rules of art and polite society, so that the viewer or participant is not swept up in the sublimity or beauty that is the Western ideal, but in feelings of sadness, indignation, repentance, hope, and the determination to change things in the future.

You may not see much decolonial art at Cambridge, but, just as the colonial aesthetic works on us in myriad and subtle ways, so can performances of decoloniality, if we learn how to see them. So as you walk through the grand college gates, look out for the homeless man, who refuses to move from his corner no matter what important procession passes by.

Look out for the posters put up by the residents of Mill Road, in their campaign against the large-chain supermarket that would put the small Indian and Korean grocery stores there out of business. Think about the British Indian girl who wears a sari to class every day. And listen again to Joshua’s accent, and hear in it not failure to communicate, but a casual, everyday protest – a way of saying, I don’t have to sound like you to be worthy of being heard.

These things may be hard to spot amidst the distractions of tall spires and lofty aspirations, but they are there.""","""To my eighteen-year-old self, on your departure for Cambridge"" – 2003 essay, still relevant (re: Singlish, culture, etc)"

singapore,"hiiiiii iz me im back

Here's some background in case you don't recognise my username (LOL that sounded more arrogant than intended):
*[Hoarding story part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3oqafn/daughter_of_a_hoarder/)
*[Hoarding story part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3swp8o/im_the_hoarders_daughter_im_back_and_i_need/)

Hi! The last time I posted anything, it was a short update on the daily thread that I'd moved to my dad's house.

I'm pretty fortunate compared to anyone who might find themselves in a situation like mine; somehow I've been lucky enough to get a scholarship that not only covers my university tuition fees and accommodation, but gives me a monthly allowance on top of that. So I've only lived with my dad for a short while, and I now have my ""own"" place (staying in a hall in uni) where I am pretty comfortable and happy. :)

It's been almost 6 months since I've left home, and I do not regret a single day since I've made that decision. Occasionally though, I will start to think of my mum and question if I should attempt to reconcile with her. However, thoughts of her abusive words and actions never fail to make me die a little more inside, and thinking just of the state of her house makes me shut down all thoughts of reconciliation.

While she has always doted on my brother more than me, he doesn't do as well as me academically and I fear that she will soon put immense pressure on him since he's taking his O levels next year. Reading the post about the teenage suicide rate being the highest in 15 years sent a chill down my spine as I have ever thought of suicide, and, while I want to believe otherwise, I'm fairly certain my brother has as well. Not only is my mum a hoarder, the amount of pressure she puts on me academically is really quite interesting (e.g. I got 262 for PSLE– it wasn't enough for her as I was brought home and very very harshly reprimanded and then made to feel ashamed of myself for at least a whole year after that).

And while the idea that academic success isn't all that matters have somehow started to dawn on her seeing my brother not do as well as I did for PSLE, she continues to pressure him by sending him for not only tuition but instrument classes for 2 INSTRUMENTS as well. My brother was one of the main reasons holding me back from suicide, and I cannot find it in me to see him be put under all this unnecessary pressure without doing anything to help him. He's ever told me he's very stressed because of my mum and then broke down in front of me. It breaks my heart as an older sister.

I want to help him eventually find a way out of that hellhole too, but one thing's stopping me– what will my mum do?

She has been unemployed ever since I was born (I'm 19), and most of her life has revolved around taking care of her children (and also her late mother) from then on. I now know this is not really the norm, but she receives quite a lot of alimony from my dad (it's quite a few K) and hasn't actually *needed* to work. Yet she tries to earn passive income, and consequently has been involved in, I kid you not, at least 5 MLM schemes. Obviously, none of them succeeded in making her a billionaire and honestly have probably made us poorer. lol

Right now, other than presumably taking care of my brother (I wouldn't quite know, haven't exactly spoken to her in 6 months...) she spends a LOT of her time involved in church activities. But other than that, I don't know what she's doing with her time. Probably making jewellery that she'll never sell (I'm not trying to be a smartass here. This is a very factual statement.) or watching TV. 

If I ever one day help my brother away from her, I really don't know what she will do. If she can text me things like ""I wanted to jump down the 16th floor when I found out your dad had another woman 10 years ago, but I didn't because I had two young kids. I think now is the time."" after I'd left the house, can you imagine the possibility of her actually following through those words when her other child leaves as well?

I don't really know what I can, or *should* do. I would appreciate any thoughts or advice. For those that have followed my story since the start, thank you for your support over the past year. ♥

singapore,"There is a situation with someone close to me, who was confronted with intensely racist and violent remarks of a co-worker (including suggesting death) targeted towards a specific racial group, that he/she belongs to, via a personal blog post.

The employer in question, once made aware via third parties and subsequent internal complaints, decided to throw its hands in the air and said it had no control over out-of-work activities and would take no action. It was said this constituted his right to freedom of speech and expression. My friend was suggested to have a coffee with this person and to -politely- convey their feelings. I wish I was joking.

I am wondering if anyone here would have any experience with a similar situation and how to handle it, perhaps even legally? I would think that the rights of free speech do not extent to hateful, vehemently racist slurring and suggesting bodily harm, even if these take place outside of the workplace.

I hope I'm asking in the right place. Thanks in advance!

singapore,"This happened hours ago

I was playing video games in a LAN shop/computer shop. I could tell I was the youngest and looked foreign as everyone else was Chinese, although I was 18.

While playing my games, an officer in uniform tapped me on my shoulder and kindly asked for my IC, with his partner. I thought I was in deep deep trouble. I initially said I didn't bring it and showed my wallet to them to prove it (My IC was hiding in a secret pocket of the wallet). However, I accidentally flipped the wallet and they saw it. So I handed it to them and said it was an honest mistake.

So they were talking into their radio/each other. I was really afraid of what was going on. Two officers surrounding me, while gamers filled the shop. My heart went to adrenaline mode. I breathed calmly and continued to play, and I noticed that one of the officers were watching me play and they were a bit impressed ahahaha.

Anyway, back to the topic, after I took in a few deep breaths, I turned back and asked them if there was a problem. He said ""No, we're just doing a check"". After a while, they returned it back to me and said thank you and left.

With paranoid me, I've got questions to ask:

-Am I in trouble?

-Why me?

-Is this normal? I've never heard of a 'check' other than the bag check in the MRT

-What are they 'checking' exactly?

Edit : Thank you for the replies! It really comforted me. I'm still shaking from the experience.

singapore,"Hi all.  I would like to read more unbiased, detailed information and arguments about the TPP, specifically the impact on the your average Singaporeans. (First posted this on ELI5, but seems the bot thinks it is better suit for other subreddit) My search for information about TPP seems vague (due to the secrecy nature) and always points towards negative consequences for the average citizens. Most of the sources also seems to talk about the impact on U.S. If I am not wrong, we don't exactly have a big economy relative to other nations in TPP i.e Japan, and it seems suspicious to me that our Prime Minister is trying so hard and desperate to push for TPP, right after the US election, amid the raising concern that newly elected Trump may decide to withdraw from TPP. 

The best information that I have found is these 2 post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3nl4sz/eli5_the_transpacific_partnership_deal/cvp5gid/
Thank you /u/thimblefullofdespair

https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/599u3i/does_anyone_here_understand_the_tpp_trans_pacific/d96th3b/ (Thank you /u/DavlosEve)

From what I understand (shortened version) (Please correct me if I am wrong):

- TPP is a trade pact to reduce the economic power of China. 

- More stringent control over patent rules.

- Free movement of labour. 

- Open trade.

- Increase cost in medications.

In Singapore, our country is right in the middle of many business trade routes and the media have said that it will improve out economy. I am skeptical due to such a high secrecy involving this TPP. Most importantly, what is the impact on the average citizen? 

I would like to add that, it's not that I am xenophobic, I am more concern about the depressing wages faced by many people. A couple of questions on my mind. Would this TPP further worsen the problem? Does such a deal actually further widens the rich and poor gap? Lastly, does the patent laws or regulations increase medicine price? 

However, proponents of TPP that there is a short term negative consequences but better in the long run such as job loss while a different sector grow and it is overall, better than a China-led trade pact.

My understanding of economics is very shallow so do correct me if my understanding is wrong. If possible, do drop me a few links or resources that is as unbiased as it can be. I am sure most sources have their own bias but I want to read up as much information as I can. Thank you very much everyone. ",Some questions about TPP impact on Singapore.

For one, we could really use a monitor that tells us what stop is next. I saw it when taking the buses in Seoul, South Korea, and bloody hell is it useful. I can get to anywhere without knowing a word of Korean because the english voiceover and screen tells me how many stops and where I am headed, like our MRT (except half the time its broke as fuck and all the stations light up) 

Its really annoying when you have to always check which stop to alight at, and even now(don't know about you guys) I still alight at the wrong station because either I thought the stop is my stop, or I'm not which stop to stop at. Its one of the reasons probably why so few tourists know how to take the bus.

Also, the whole automated time boards could be placed at busier bus stops. Its really handy to know where I am going if I ain't using my phone or just to make sure that the timings are right.

Just my two cents, but overall its pretty decent.

I have a bit of an emergency situation here. My aunt is 82 this year, very frail but still incredibly lucid mentally. She was previously living alone but 2 years ago she allowed her good for nothing son to come back and live with her after much begging as he was in a heap of credit card debt and jobless for the past year.

Onto the gist of the issue - he has been abusing her in private, told her that if she dares to report to the police he won't hesitate to kill her. Every 2-3 days he locks her in a room and screams at her and beats her where it's not visible to the public eye (arms, thighs, legs) and today it has escalated to her face, where there is light but visible bruising. He also told her 'if not for the Singapore law, i would have crushed you into pieces long ago'. My aunt doesn't want to go to the police because she doesn't want to ruin her son's life and she's afraid he won't be able to find a job in the future. Regardless of all the coaxing we've done, she's determined to keep mum about this. All this abuse has been slowly escalating over the 2 years he's become violent with her.

What's worrying is that today she passed my dad a bunch of her valuables and daily necessities, saying she won't have a use for all these things anymore. She doesn't even want to top up her ez-link card because she says she won't need it much longer. She said that she's old enough and just wants to go already and not stay any longer in this living hell, she has no interest in running away or pressing charges.

I've tried calling AWARE but they said nothing can be done if she doesn't want to admit that she's facing any abuse. If we call the police on him and they go and check on the situation, he will beat her to death after that for sure. We're really at a loss right now, she's either going to take her own life or get killed by her son.

Does anyone know of any alternative options to contact to get him evicted if she doesn't admit to the abuse? Would appreciate any help now, thank you in advance!",Domestic abuse issues

singapore,"So today I received this response from Cherry Credits... after almost a month of back and forth. 

http://imgur.com/h3Obvpk

Am I SOL on this? Is it even legal for Cherry Credits to do this?

Backstory, a few months back my account was compromised and all funds cleaned out from it.
No notification was sent for any of the 20+ transactions that were made. So I didn't know of it until randomly checking my account.

Cherry credits took 1 month to respond, and the only said they were ""investigating"", followed by locking the ticket. I've never seen more worse customer service in my life. Normally any other sane service that involve money like PayPal and Credit card have some basic fraud management.

And yes, I have their ""security pin"" feature enabled a few years back.",Cherry credits customer service
singapore,"Think about it, people have been comfortable with Indian, Chinese presidents, and nothing happened within the Malay community that would catalyse such a move. 

The main point of this exercise is to move the presidency to be under the control of parliament which is controlled of PAP. 

I don't hate PAP, or any other party for that matter, but baiting citizens using the race issue when its actually about control is morally wrong. 

At least a referendum should be conducted on the matter.

The seats on the bus were very narrow given his size; it did not help that he was resting his arm on the very short arm rest between the bus seats. His entire body and shoulder was leaning towards me with his shoulders brushing against mine!!! (personal space invaded!!!) It made me feel extremely uncomfortable and I started shifting away towards the empty seat adjacent to mine.

I don't know if it was my annoyed expression that gave me away but a guy sitting opposite me leaned forward and asked me if i wanted to switch seats with him. I was so surprised (in a good way) but shook my head and said no because I was getting off the next stop. I didn't get to thank him properly for such a gentlemanly gesture (I regret this very much)!! I hope for good and happy things to happen to him for showing such kindness!

They were very professional, send 2 officers down to my neighbors. However, I am not sure what action was taken. Want to ask what is the best way to deal with this?

And you have to put your entire family history and details ( I'm exaggerating but its a shiton of useless info for a wifi access) 


Plus, if you are a tourist or a foreigner, you need to KEY IN YOUR NUMBER TO GET AN SMS. This is just stupid.

singapore,"My theory is that Yishun, and all that related talk about how Yishun is a terrible town is just... that. Talk.

Remember a few years back, when Bedok Reservoir became a meme because too many people went there and drowned?

I'm reminded of the Bermuda Triangle - where the number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater, proportionally speaking, than in any other part of the ocean. (according to Lawrence David Kusche). 

Some facts:

* Yishun is, after Bedok, Tuas and Changi, the fourth largest non-water catchment area on the Singapore island.
* Over time, there is little variance in the number of cases of dengue in different regions.
* Other places have also seen cat abuse (notably, [Beach Road](http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/09/22/desperate-call-for-action-by-cat-feeders-of-beach-road/), [Tampines](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/25-year-old-man-arrested-for-cat-abuse-case-in-tampines), [Toa Payoh](https://tippedearclan.wordpress.com/tag/animal-abuse/), [Jurong](http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/cat-killings-two-dead-cats-found-jurong-west-and-bishan)). Cat abusers are everywhere. 
* The mystery man who was purportedly selling religious stickers appeared both in Bukit Merah as well

It's also likely that because pro-animal welfare people are representatives at Nee Soon GRC, that volunteers who take care of the cats there are empowered to take more action and report shit like that to the police. (If you follow their page, they have a practice of shocking people into action) Hence the start of this whole 'Yishun is a cat killer town' meme.

Also: it's likely that the meme about Bedok Reservoir being a place for unnatural deaths (suicide) caused copycats to go there. In the past two years, bodies have been found at Woodlands Waterfront Park, MacRitchie, Lower Seletar and Pandan Reservoir. 

Technically, without the appropriate data, it's hard to say which place is the absolute worst. But it's also entirely possible that the idea that Yishun being a terrible town is all in our heads (or something).

tl;dr it's all in your heads",What if our fixation on Yishun is actually just part of our imagination?

singapore,"Background: I'm 22 this year. I came from an elite boys' school, from p1 to sec 4. Scored a single digit for O levels but it wasn't good enough for a 1st tier JC, so I went to a 2nd tier one. 

In JC, I was complacent and played a lot, even retained in JC2 (U-turning, as we called it). As expected, my A levels results were abysmal: CDD/C. I don't know why but I didn't think of retaking my A levels. I kept thinking of doing it when I saw some friends in NS do it, but I just wanted to play. In the end, I enrolled in SIM (UOL) and I'm in my 1st year now.

Now that I'm in UOL/SIM, I'm working hard. But when I meet up with my NS buddies or my JC friends, I hear what they're learning in local Unis, or the experiences they're having, and I'm immensely envious. I don't get the same opportunities as my fellow peers. In UOL, all we have are lectures so there's aren't many chances to speak up and learn as well. I've been mulling over this for so long and I'm at a loss.

So far what I've thought is, I could:

1) Retake my A levels next year. But I'll be 23 and if I do well, I'll only enter University at 24. 

2) Stick through 3 more years at UOL, do well, and get a good job. But I don't want to miss out on the local Uni experience and opportunities that come with.

I'm really at a loss now. I welcome all advice.","Screwed up my educational life, what do I do now? When is it too old to stop trying? Advice please."

But before that I'm interested in how fellow Singaporeans view tattoos in our society. 

1) Would you say there's still this stigma attached to tattoos where people view it kinda as mark of gangsters or it shows that you're a bad person kinda thing? 

2) How likely, or unlikely are companies or employers to hire people with visible tattoos? 

3) For those of you who have tattoos, would you say that people look at you or treat you in a different kind of way just because of your tattoos? E.g friends, family members, strangers etc

4) For those of you who don't have tattoos, do you feel like you treat or view people with tattoos differently in any way? 

5) Last question would be, for those who have gotten tattoos, be it small ones or big ones, have you ever regretted getting it? Or have you ever thought about getting more after? 

Obviously this is not a post to spark a debate on whether should people get tattoos or to debate about whether you think tattoos are stupid, I'm just interested in how Singaporeans view tattoos, so try to keep the comments nice, thanks guys :) ",Tattoo stigma in Singapore

singapore,"Eg Kalos was based on France, Unova on New York and the earlier regions like Kanto and Johto were  based on cities in Japan. 

So how would you design the location, lore and designs of the plot, gyms, towns and Pokémon based on Singapore? 

For example, a city with a huge mall (like celadon or goldenrod) based on orchard or jurong east shopping district.  For some reason, I  associate Chinese Garden with dragons, so I would add a town based on it and have a dragon type gym there. 

Maybe add the evil team's HQ in Yishun or something. A dark or fighting type gym there would be pretty sweet too. I can't think of a motive for the evil team though based on sg context, but I guess a team based on grumpy &amp; overly entitled elderly?

singapore,"I am a class 2 holder and an ex motorcycle owner. I really wanted to get a new one and my fiance was very unhappy about it, because of the risks and all. And with that I deferred purchasing a motorcycle.

Today is the day, I think, that has sealed my decision to not buy one, indefinitely. As I was returning home in a taxi, we came across really slow moving traffic near keat hong lrt. Must've been a breakdown or a fender bender, I thought. But no.

It was a motorcycle accident. One of those delivery boys on a motorcycle with an orange box (is it food panda?). His bike lay smashed, lying on the road, and emergency vehicles had not made it there yet. And he was there, motionless, his body was twisted where his chest faced upward and his hips faced sideward 90°, while his legs faced the ground. He was in such a position that you can't achieve even with extreme yoga. Maybe a contortionist can.

The looks of it, he didn't make it. But even if he did, he'd live a very limited version of life. I felt really sad for him and his family. Just a regular day, just a regular delivery, and bam, your life end or changes completely.

There was a dented car on the opposite side of the road, so it appears like the delivery guy got into an accident and flew across the road to our side. It doesn't even matter who's at fault here. 

So, guys, I just wanted to share - do consider not getting a bike. And if you do, ride very defensively.",To everyone thinking about getting a motorcycle

singapore,"This isn’t to discuss the UK and US politics/policies/who was right/who was wrong. When I do bring it up, it’s only to illustrate my point with respect to the LGBT acceptance movement in Singapore. 

I’d like to highlight that in these two countries, there is clearly a wide chasm between two major groups of people who refuse to engage each other from a place of a desire to listen. Instead, they approach the other side from a place of deeply entrenched vitriol which I believe arose from a massive build up of misunderstanding. The consequences were disastrous.  I’m afraid it might happen to Singapore and it could very well stem from the LGBT discourse, so I want to address that concern.

Firstly, I’m a gay person.  So you can be sure I’m definitely for LGBT rights in Singapore. Let’s get that out of the way. 

There is a very strong ‘Us’ vs ‘Them’ mentality in both the UK and US. This 50-50 phenomenon didn’t just spontaneously happen overnight. It was a culmination of years perhaps decades of one side repeatedly dismissing the other side as being bigots or being blindly politically correct when the reality is, most of the people in both camps aren’t bigots and aren’t neo liberal Nazis at all. It’s the fringe groups on both sides that are fanning the flames and as a result, everyone got caught up in the rhetoric and turned against each other. It could have been avoided if people just engaged each other with the intention to listen. 

The Singapore LGBT discourse equivalent of that would be one group, in our zeal for progress, yelling “you homophobes” and the other group who is neutral and now perceive them to be intolerant as a result, shouting “you militant gays”. 

Let me be clear, I am not disputing the fact that there are homophobes in our society. By homophobes, I mean people who are utterly absolutely not willing to have a conversation at all. They definitely exist, fundamentalists etc. I’m not going to talk about them because I don’t want to spend energy where it won’t make a difference. 

I want to talk about the neutral people and the ignorant-but-not-homophobic people and our interaction with them. When I say ‘ignorant’, I’m not judging them because everyone starts from ignorance. I’m sure there’re things in wider society I’m super ignorant of. 

I’m worried that the LGBT discourse in our country might turn into a Shakespearean tragedy like Brexit and the US election because, in our zeal for progress, we are prone to steamrolling the neutral people with “What? How can you stay neutral when you know people are being discriminated against? You homophobe!” (I have been guilty of this; mainly railing against our government)

Their natural and understandable response would then be “You militant gays! I don’t agree with the religious bigotry but damn, you guys are pushy, you’re not helping me like you enough to want to stand up for you!”

If that is how we begin the conversation, we can be assured that it will take longer for them to favour our cause. This hurts progress in the long run. 

These middle people are most likely to eventually be on our side if they are allowed the time and space to get involved in the discourse because right now, LGBT issues aren’t at the top of their consciousness. It’s similar to me not thinking much about let’s say... aboriginal discrimination in Australia. It’s not because I hate them but because I *haven’t had the chance* to know them and want to care and fight for them yet. I believe this is what our PM has been hinting at but cannot openly say. 

But then you might say “LGBT people who’re alive today don’t have the luxury of time to wait around for people to come onboard. We want our rights, we want it now.” 

I completely feel where you’re coming from and it’s not wrong to feel that way.

*I understand the frustration. I’m gay woman too. I know how it feels. ~~like masturbating for a long time but being unable to cum even though I'm due for one~~*

But consider Brexit and the election. In each case, half were for, half were against. A hardline position was ultimately taken and one half rioted/protested, benefiting no one, not even the other half because the country is now in chaos. Everybody becomes collateral damage from the fallout, and moving forward is near impossible because there is an extremely fierce gridlock. 

I used to dismiss our government’s rhetoric of “let’s not force the issue because it will divide the country and make things worse” as low key homophobia. But now, looking at the UK and US, I’m glad that our government did not take a hardline stand. Instead, they chose an ambiguous stance which has allowed a space for discourse to continue, and allowed time for the neutral people and ignorant-but-not-homophobic people to get involved in the discourse. 

It’s easy to let our enthusiasm for progress distort our perception of what’s actually helping us. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still keeping an eye on Christian politicians. But so far, they have not outright said fuck the gays or outright shut down pinkdot, and our government has indeed kept the peace. So, there is still room for discussion.

So then, does it feel unfair to let the majority “take their time” while we continue to wait in frustration? Of course it does. 

I’m not dismissing our frustration as petulant impatience. It’s completely understandable to feel that way. But we need the majority to be firmly on our side. We really do.

Because when we try to green light a motion, any motion, without support of the majority, messy things tend to happen. Brexit is going to take a long time to sort itself out if it does at all. ~~jilted lover EU gonna want half~~ Trump is going to have an ultra mighty hard time putting out the fires and uniting the country under his ~~rule~~ presidency. Friendly reminder, the UK and US situations aren’t the main talk of this piece. I’m just trying to illustrate my point. 

It’s easy to feel like we’re not making progress. But have hope. I believe we are *moving in the right direction*.

Regarding the MHA foreign sponsorship debacle with pinkdot, let’s choose to look at it this way: 

We have been relying on the safety net of “foreign” support, and now that net is removed. 

We can either clamour to get it back and get ourselves shut down for being (perceived) militant. Or we can step out of our comfort zone and get local corporate sponsors on board to build real and tangible support. This is where we can start to have conversations with the neutrals and the non-opinionated.

So far, the public narrative is ‘the gays + foreign ideology’ vs ‘local conservative values’. I’m not saying it’s factual, *but it’s what the wider public perceives*, and public perception is really important in helping to turn the tide. Getting more local corporate sponsors would turn the narrative into ‘more Singaporeans are accepting their LGBT friends and families’. 

I believe this “headline” would help raise the LGBT issue to the forefront of public consciousness where it really matters because it would have an arguably faster cascading effect of understanding and eventual acceptance as opposed to “we’re being invaded by foreign ideology!” Think Inception the 2010 movie. The idea has to come from within for it to be accepted without question. 

When MHA also simultaneously removed the requirement for local corporations to get a permit, I believe they’re trying to say “getting local support is the way forward for you guys, let’s make it a bit easier for you to step in that direction by removing this requirement.” But of course, they cannot openly say that because they have to maintain an appearance of neutrality. 

In the end, as an LGBT person, I want to be heard and accepted.

But I must also want to hear others and engage in meaningful perspective-changing conversation because that is the only way to obtain progress *AND secure it firmly*. 

I don’t want us to sabotage ourselves by steamrolling the neutral folk. Unsupported progress is flimsy and can be crumbled by a push back.

We need progress that has *staying power*. And it's only achievable by moving forward with the majority in mutual trust, agreement and general good feeling, not in a pressure cooker of resentment and suspicion. 

Trump’s bulldoze style campaign to the presidency has half the country hating him and they’re now sure as hell going to oppose his every move. (Another friendly reminder that this post isn't about if he's good or bad, I'm just illustrating my point) It’s a clear example of ""yeah, but we might not be able to fix the collateral damage"".

Let’s not allow that to happen to the LGBT community in Singapore. 

Have a good weekend everyone!

But you know what? Fuck that. I smile when I see our broken MRT in the national news, not because it's broken, but because that's our fucking safety relief valve. When we complain about CPF, NS, or politicians who have no PR skills, that's the thing that prevents this country from melting down every five years or so, with half the population in tears and causing the Canadian immigration website to crash.


As an adult, hearing all of you bitch on the internet is like music to my ears, because quite frankly, maybe it's not so bad that none of us have filters and our complaints vacillate between high-level abstractions and trivial shit. And maybe one day the tone of that conversation will change: Maybe one day the disenfranchised will voice concerns that cut deep into the pillars of our society, and we will have to question who we really want to be. But I want to hear that voice before it stuns me by electing an orange. 


So complain away, my friends &lt;3

It has been a contentious, ugly election season, that has exposed a bitter divide in the American people. Many will celebrate this result, while others will understandably be surprised and disappointed. But like the Brexit referendum in June, Mr Trump’s victory is part of a broader pattern in developed countries – reflecting a deep frustration with the way things are, and a strong wish to reassert a sense of identity, and somehow to change the status quo.

US voters have elected a President whom they feel best represents them. Singapore fully respects their decision. We will continue to work together with the United States to cultivate our strong ties. – LHL

singapore,"Hi /r/singapore,

I'm traveling through SE Asia and am in Singapore for the next 2 nights.  While in Indonesia I kicked an edge at the bottom of a swimming pool and split my toe open, needing three stitches.  It's been about 11 days now I think they need to come out.  

Can anyone recommend a way to have a medical professional here do it, on the cheap?  I don't have traveller's or health insurance, so I'll be paying out of pocket.  In Indonesia, that was cheap, but I assume it will be more here.  I just need a doctor to look at it and say ""no it's not infected, yes the stitches can come out now, let's remove the stitches"".

Thanks in advance.",Get stitches removed from my toe on the cheap?
singapore,"How does it work. I now you have to clock a number of points to stay, earned through CCA participation. But how many CCAs do you have to join? Is it a lot? Can you just stick to one or two? I hear people join quite a few, which isn't my cup of tea, I would prefer to focus on one or two.

Also, how does joining the actual Uni team for a sport work then, does that allow you to get points as well? I'm asking because I want to join the uni team for a sport, so how would that affect the hall points, would you able to earn hall credit playing sport at the uni level.

singapore,"You know, I've been thinking, we like to think of ourselves as really passionate about food (more specifically local food, but that's not my issue here) but nobody seems to point out that we are, also very largely food followers. Not to say that its always bad, but fuck, do we GO CRAZY ON SOME FOOD TRENDS.

Like the whole BLOODY SALTED EGG YOLK CRAZE is going a little overboard. It started out fine, but then now all the damn cafes are just jumping on the whole salted egg craze, charging exorbitant amounts for some salted egg flavoured food (I remembered there is a prata bomb with salted egg costing a whopping $9)

Not to forget, the recent pasar malam which I visit over hari raya were all selling the same hyped up foods. I saw at least 5 stalls or so selling churros (and of course, coming in salted egg sauces) and also the whole deal with Thai iced milk tea. Just last year, the Thai ice rolled ice cream was the whole big thing. 

And wayyy before, when cafes went booming, charging crazy amounts for a half cooked egg on some toast, rainbow coloured sponge cakes that cost 8 bucks a slice, and a shitload of rainbow food coloured desserts and macarons was the trend. Of course, and now, the whole bingsu and crazy looking milkshakes that are likely to give you instant diabetes with the stacks of desserts on it.

The deal is, our food scene, outside of hawker foods, are just really terribly looking(and frankly I don't even think we deserve the michelin guide since most of the fine dining aren't that amazing but that's another issue). We like to think of ourselves as foodies, but once outside of hawker food, everything is just about the latest food trend on smart local, mothership, or whatever social media post from ladyironchef. The irony is that most of us won't even spend $30 bucks on a lunch time meal at a somewhat atas restaurant, but are totally fine with spending well over $50 on some cafes who are really good at making foods that look good on instagram. The whole hipster trendy food scene is really getting on my nerves, when places just hop on the next big thing and everyone just jumps in on it cause they saw their friend post some pretty photos on instagram. ","Nation of food lovers, or food followers?"
